<H1>Abstract</H1>

<P>
This SRFI specifies the procedure <TT>make-table</TT>, a hash table
constructor compatible with <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-69/">SRFI 69
(Basic hash tables)</a>.  The procedure <TT>make-table</TT>
allows various parameters of the hash
table to be specified with optional named parameters when it is
constructed.  These parameters are: the initial size, the minimum and
maximum load factor, the key equivalence function, the key hashing
function, whether the references to the keys are weak, and similarly
for the values.  By using optional named parameters, as specified in
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-89/">SRFI 89 (Optional positional and named parameters)</a>, the constructor's API can be easily
extended in a backward compatible way by other SRFIs and Scheme
implementations.
<P>

<H1>Rationale</H1>

<P>
SRFI 69 specifies ``basic hash tables''.  It provides the procedure
<TT>make-hash-table</TT> to construct hash tables, and a set of
procedures to operate on hash tables.
</P>

<P>
SRFI 69's <TT>make-hash-table</TT> accepts two optional positional
parameters: a procedure to test whether two keys are equal and a
procedure to hash keys.  There are several other hash table
implementations (in Scheme and other languages) which allow other
aspects of the hash table to be specified when the hash table is
constructed, mainly to improve performance.  For instance:
</P>

<OL>

<LI>
<STRONG>The initial size of the hash table</STRONG>.  This parameter
is useful to reduce the cost of resizing the hash table when it is
known that the hash table will contain many keys.  Even though
SRFI 69 does not provide a <I>size</I> parameter, the implementation
in SRFI 69 handles the third optional positional parameter as a
<I>size</I> parameter.

<LI>
<STRONG>The minimum and maximum load of the hash table</STRONG>.
These parameters are useful to control the amount of key collisions,
which affects performance of hash table lookup, insertion, and
resizing.  The load is a measure of space efficiency.  It is the space
used by the (active) key/value associations divided by the total space
used by the hash table.  A load close to 0 offers fast lookup and
insertion operations, but is not space efficient.  A load close to 1
is very space efficient, but operations are slow.  The implementation
can dynamically resize the hash table to keep the load roughly between
the minimum and maximum load (the load may not be exactly within the
bounds due to implementation constraints, such as keeping at least one
free entry in the hash table and requiring the size of the table to be
a prime number).

<LI>
<STRONG>The ``strength'' of references to the keys and
values</STRONG>.  Some runtime systems support two types of object
references: <I>weak</I> references and <I>strong</I> references.  When
the garbage collector determines that the only references to an object
are weak, it can reclaim that object.  In the case of hash tables, if
the keys are considered to be weak references then the garbage
collector can reclaim the key and that entry of the hash table if the
key is only referred to with weak references.  This feature is
particularly useful with <TT>eq?</TT> hash tables to attach
auxiliary information to objects without affecting the liveness of
these objects (for example serial numbers and access mutexes).
Similarly, if the values are considered to be weak references then the
garbage collector can reclaim the value and that entry of the hash
table if the value is only referred to with weak references.

</OL>

<P>
These parameters have reasonable implementation
dependent default values:
</P>

<OL>

<LI>
<STRONG>Initial size:</STRONG> 0 or a small number

<LI>
<STRONG>Minimum load:</STRONG> 0.5

<LI>
<STRONG>Maximum load:</STRONG> 0.8

<LI>
<STRONG>Key reference weakness:</STRONG> false

<LI>
<STRONG>Value reference weakness:</STRONG> false

</OL>

<P>
Given that there are several parameters and that they all have
reasonable default values, it is appropriate to use optional named
parameters to pass them to the constructor.  This makes it possible
for other SRFIs and Scheme implementations to extended the API in a
backward compatible way.
</P>

<H1>Specification</H1>

<P>
The <TT>make-table</TT> procedure accepts optional named
parameters as though it was defined using the
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-89/">SRFI 89
(Optional positional and named parameters)</a> <TT>define*</TT> form
like this:
</P>

<PRE>
    (define* (make-table
              (test:        test        equal?)
              (hash:        hash        <I>H</I>)
              (size:        size        <I>S</I>)
              (min-load:    min-load    <I>MINL</I>)
              (max-load:    max-load    <I>MAXL</I>)
              (weak-keys:   weak-keys   #f)
              (weak-values: weak-values #f))
      ...)
</PRE>

<P>
The default values <I>S</I>, <I>MINL</I>, and <I>MAXL</I> are
implementation dependent.  The default value <I>H</I> is also
implementation dependent but it must be consistent with the
<I>test</I> parameter (i.e. <TT>(test X Y)</TT> implies <TT>(= (hash X)
(hash Y))</TT>).  If supplied explicitly the <I>test</I>
parameter must be a two-parameter equivalence procedure, the
<I>hash</I> parameter must be a one-parameter hash function
consistent with <I>test</I>, the <I>size</I> parameter
must be a nonnegative exact integer, and the <I>min-load</I>
and <I>max-load</I> parameters must be real numbers in the
range 0 to 1 and <I>min-load</I> must be less than <I>max-load</I>.
</P>

<P>
The parameters <I>size</I>, <I>min-load</I>, <I>max-load</I>,
<I>weak-keys</I> and <I>weak-values</I> provide information that can
be useful to improve the performance of the runtime system.  However,
the implementation can choose to ignore any of these parameters if
they have no meaning for the runtime system.  In other words these are
purely advisory parameters.
</P>

    (object-&#62;serial-number obj3)  ==&#62;  3
    (serial-number-&#62;object 1)     ==&#62;  (1 11)
    (serial-number-&#62;object 2)     ==&#62;  (2 22) or #f
</PRE>

<H1>Implementation</H1>

<P>
The following implementation requires <a
href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-69/">SRFI 69 (Basic hash
tables)</a> and <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-89/">SRFI 89
(Optional positional and named parameters)</a>.  It defines the
<TT>make-table</TT> procedure to accept its parameters using
optional named parameters and passes them to <TT>make-hash-table</TT>:
</P>

<PRE>
(define make-table
  (let ((absent (list 'absent)))
    (lambda* ((test:        test        absent)
              (hash:        hash        absent)
              (size:        size        0)
              (min-load:    min-load    0)
              (max-load:    max-load    1)
              (weak-keys:   weak-keys   #f)
              (weak-values: weak-values #f))
      (cond ((eq? test absent)
             (if (eq? hash absent)
                 (make-hash-table)
                 (make-hash-table equal? hash)))
            ((eq? hash absent)
             (make-hash-table test))
            (else
             (make-hash-table test hash))))))
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the implementation conforms to this SRFI even though it
ignores the parameters <I>size</I>, <I>min-load</I>, <I>max-load</I>,
<I>weak-keys</I> and <I>weak-values</I>.  A more complete treatment of
these parameters would require implementation dependent changes to the
runtime system.
