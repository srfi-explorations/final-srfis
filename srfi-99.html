<h1><a name="Abstract">Abstract</a></h1>

<p>
Many Scheme programmers have considered records to be one
of the most important features missing from the R5RS.
The R6RS proposed a record system, but its design has
been widely criticized and it was not intended for use
in R5RS programs anyway.
</p>

<p>
This SRFI proposes a better record system for use in R5RS,
ERR5RS, and R6RS programs.  The syntactic layer of this
SRFI's record system is an extension of SRFI 9.  The
procedural and inspection layers of this SRFI's record
system are perfectly compatible with its syntactic layer.
This entire SRFI is compatible with the procedural and
inspection layers of the R6RS record system, but offers
several worthwhile improvements over the R6RS system.

<h1><a name="Rationale">Rationale</a></h1>

<p>
In most programming languages, records (aka structures
or classes) are important because they can package
component values of different types into a single object.
</p>

<p>
Scheme's vectors and procedures provided that capability
already, but records remained important for two reasons:
</p>

<div>
<ul><li>Records make it easier to index components by their names.
    </li>
    <li>Records can introduce new types in the sense that all
        previous type predicates return false for instances of
        the new record type, while the new predicate associated
        with the new record type returns true only for instances
        of the new record type.
    </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
For many programmers, records were the most important
new feature of the R6RS, but the specific record systems
that were proposed by the R6RS have been widely criticized.
Over 30% of those who voted against ratification mentioned
the record systems as one of their reasons.
<sup><a href="#note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
The ERR5RS record system described by this SRFI provides
a simpler and fully portable alternative to the R6RS record
system.
The ERR5RS record system consists of
</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li>a syntactic layer, which is fully compatible with SRFI 9
    but extends SRFI 9 with inheritance and with more succinct
    syntax for common use cases</li>
<li>a procedural layer, which is simpler and easier to use
    than the procedural layer of R6RS records but remains
    fully compatible with the R6RS procedural layer</li>
<li>an inspection layer, which is simpler and easier to use
    than the inspection layer of R6RS records but remains
    fully compatible with the R6RS inspection layer</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The ERR5RS record system does not mandate support for the
non-generative, sealed, and/or opaque features of the R6RS
record system.
Implementations of this SRFI may extend the ERR5RS record
system to support those features, however, and this SRFI
recommends an API to implementations that support those
features.
With those extensions, the ERR5RS record system has the
same expressive power as the R6RS record system.  Hence
the record system described by this SRFI can serve as
either or both of the following:
</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li>an efficient and relatively simple foundation for
    implementing the R6RS record system</li>
<li>a simpler and fully portable alternative to the R6RS
    record system</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
<!--
To improve upon this unsatisfactory outcome, we should
first understand how it happened.
-->
The following subsections develop the rationale for this
SRFI by considering
</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>the history of records in Scheme before the R6RS</li>
<li>R6RS records</li>
<li>the design rationale for ERR5RS records</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2><a name="History">Records Before R6RS</a></h2>

<p>
The importance of adding records to Scheme has been
recognized for more than twenty years.
<sup><a href="#note-2">[2]</a></sup>
The basic idea behind the SRFI 9 and R6RS record systems
was outlined by Norman Adams on 8 July 1987, following
similar ideas that had been implemented in T and MIT CScheme.
<sup><a href="#note-3">[3]</a></sup>
Jonathan Rees posted a revision of Adams's proposal on
26 May 1988.
<sup><a href="#note-4">[4]</a></sup>
Pavel Curtis proposed an extension of Rees's proposal
on 18 August 1989, noting that it had been approved by
consensus at the first meeting of BASH (Bay Area Scheme
Hackers?).
<sup><a href="#note-5">[5]</a></sup>
The <code>rrrs-authors</code> archive includes several responses to
these proposals that are worth reading.
</p>

<p>
The Rees/Curtis proposal was revived in 1992.
<sup><a href="#note-6">[6]</a></sup>
When the RnRS authors met on 25 June 1992 in Palo Alto,
they felt that this proposal needed more discussion.
<sup><a href="#note-7">[7]</a></sup>
Kent Dybvig objected to the proposal on several grounds,
including the provision of inspection facilities, the
inability to define immutable records, and the use of
procedures instead of special forms.  Although 9 authors
favored adoption of the records proposal, 11 opposed it.
</p>

<p>
The topic of records was revived again on 23 April 1996 by Bruce
Duba, Matthew Flatt, and Shriram Krishnamurthi.
<sup><a href="#note-8">[8]</a></sup>
Alan Bawden
and Richard Kelsey observed that the Duba/Flatt/Krishnamurthi
proposal was essentially the same as Pavel Curtis's, which
Kelsey reposted.  Kent Dybvig objected once again, on the
same three grounds.  He also argued that procedural
interfaces are difficult to compile efficiently, and
that this inefficiency would create portability problems.
<sup><a href="#note-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
In reality, however, procedural interfaces add no inefficiency.
It is now agreed that syntactic interfaces offer no
advantages for generative records.
<sup><a href="#note-10">[10]</a></sup>
Even for non-generative records, the claimed inefficiency
consists of a single load instruction, which optimizing
compilers can eliminate---along with the entire runtime check
that includes the load instruction---for all but the first of
a sequence of operations that access the same record.  (That
optimization is a straightforward extension of the optimization
that eliminates the pair check when computing the <code>cdr</code>
of a list whose <code>car</code> has already been computed.)
Furthermore, it turns out that
even the occasional load instruction is no harder to remove
using a procedural interface than when using a syntactic
interface.
<sup><a href="#note-11">[11]</a></sup>
In R6RS library chapter 6, therefore, both of the statements that
claim an advantage in efficiency for the syntactic layer have no
basis in fact.  (These two statements appear in the next-to-last
paragraph before section 6.1, and in the note that follows
the specification of <code>parent-rtd</code>.)

</p>

<p>
On 24 April 1996, Bill Rozas suggested the idea of having
two separate APIs, one procedural and one syntactic, for
the same record facility.
<sup><a href="#note-12">[12]</a></sup>
Two days later, Dybvig proposed
a compromise along those lines
<sup><a href="#note-13">[13]</a></sup>
that incorporated several artificial restrictions,
which were apparently motivated by concerns about
the alleged extra load instruction.
<sup><a href="#note-14">[14]</a></sup>
Dybvig and Rozas continued to develop this proposal, and
presented a summary of it following the 1998 Scheme Workshop.
<sup><a href="#note-15">[15]</a></sup>
I have been unable to locate a written or online copy of
this proposal.
</p>

<p>
SRFI 9, submitted by Richard Kelsey in July 1999, is a
syntactic API in the tradition of the Rees, Curtis, and
Duba/Flatt/Krishnamurthi proposals.
<sup><a href="#note-16">[16]</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Single inheritance was added by Larceny in 1998, and by
Chez Scheme in 1999.
<sup><a href="#note-17">[17]</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
SRFI 57, submitted by Andre van Tonder in September 2004,
features label polymorphism, which can be considered a
form of structural subtyping and multiple inheritance.
<sup><a href="#note-18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>

<h2><a name="R6RSrecords">R6RS Records</a></h2>

<p>
The R6RS proposes a three-layer single inheritance system,
with syntactic, procedural, and inspection layers.
<sup><a href="#note-19">[19]</a></sup>
</p>

<h3><a name="R6RSprocedural">R6RS Records: procedural layer</a></h3>

<p>
The R6RS procedural layer generally requires at least three
separate definitions for each level of inheritance: the
record-type descriptor, at least one record-constructor
descriptor, and an actual constructor (if instances of
the record-type are to be created).
</p>

<p>
The (unratified) R6RS rationale
<sup><a href="#note-20">[20]</a></sup>
describes the
constructor-descriptor mechanism as "an infrastructure
for creating specialized constructors, rather than just
creating default constructors that accept the initial
values of all the fields as arguments.
This infrastructure achieves full generality while
leaving each level of an inheritance hierarchy in
control over its own fields and allowing child record
definitions to be abstracted away from the actual
number and contents of parent fields."
Neither the (ratified) R6RS library document nor the
(unratified) R6RS rationale consider the fact that the
constructor-descriptor mechanism adds unnecessary
complexity to what is by far the most common case:
record definitions that do not require specialized
constructors.  Neither document considers the fact
that the benefits of the constructor-descriptor
mechanism are small even when specialized constructors
are needed, as in the
<a href="#Example1">first example below</a>.
</p>

<p>
The R6RS library specification of records says that
a record type is "specified by a record-type descriptor,
which is an object that specifies the fields of the record
and various other properties that all records of that type
share."
<sup><a href="#note-21">[21]</a></sup>
Since the record-type descriptor is an object, it can be
the value of a variable that is exported by a library.
As discussed below, however, the R6RS syntactic layer uses
a different notion of record type that may be neither object
nor syntax.
</p>

<h3><a name="R6RSsyntactic">R6RS Records: syntactic layer</a></h3>

<p>
The R6RS syntactic layer consists of a
<code>define-record-type</code> syntax
that is incompatible with the syntaxes of the same name
defined by SRFI 9 and SRFI 99 (this SRFI).
</p>

<p>
According to R6RS library section 6.2, an R6RS
<code>define-record-type</code> form binds the record name
"to an expand-time or run-time representation of the record
type [that] can be used as parent name in syntactic
record-type definitions that extend this definition.
It can also be used as a handle to gain access to the
underlying record-type descriptor and constructor
descriptor".
</p>

<p>
Note that portable code cannot assume the record name is
bound to a record-type descriptor.  Portable code can only
assume that the record name is bound to "an expand-time
or run-time representation", whose semantics is not otherwise explained
by the R6RS and R6RS library documents.  In particular,
it is far from obvious that portable code can export the
record name from a library; libraries can export names that
are bound to objects or to syntax, but the R6RS does not
require the denotation of a record name to be
either of those things.
</p>

<p>
The mysterious entity to which a record name is bound can
be used as a handle to recover a record-type descriptor or
constructor descriptor by using the
<code>record-type-descriptor</code> or
<code>record-constructor-descriptor</code> syntaxes,
respectively.  The recovered record-type descriptor and
constructor descriptor may be exported from a library,
and that is apparently the only portable way for a library
to export an R6RS record type that was defined using the
R6RS syntactic layer.
</p>

<p>
The recovered record-type descriptor and constructor
descriptor also provide a way for the procedural layer
to define new record types that inherit from record
types defined by the syntactic layer.
Similarly, it is possible for the syntactic layer to
use a <code>parent-rtd</code> clause to define new
record types that inherit from record types defined
by the procedural layer.
</p>

<p>
The two notions of record type that are used by the
procedural and syntactic layers are not interchangeable,
however.  In either direction, defining a new record type
that inherits from some previously defined record type
requires the programmer to know whether the previously
defined record type was defined using the procedural or
the syntactic layer.
If the procedural and syntactic layers of the R6RS
were fully compatible, then changing a record type
definition from procedural to syntactic (or vice versa)
would be transparent to clients.  As the R6RS record
facility is defined, however, that minor change will
break all code that inherits from the record type.
</p>

<p>
R6RS library chapter 6 attempts to excuse that incompatibility,
and the interoperability and maintenance problems that
result from it, on the basis of efficiency.
Recall, however, that the claimed efficiency of the R6RS
syntactic layer is illusory.  In reality, the R6RS design
offers no advantages over a simpler and more orthogonal
design (such as the one specified by this SRFI) in which
the syntactic and procedural layers both use the same
notion of record type.
</p>

<p>
The problems described above were known and had been
documented before the R6RS documents were put to a vote,
but the R6RS documents were ratified anyway.
<sup><a href="#note-22">[22]</a></sup>
At this point, the best that can be done is to use the
SRFI process to specify a better record facility, and
to warn programmers of the problems they will encounter
if they use the record facilities described within the
R6RS library document.
</p>

<h2><a name="DesignRationale">Design Rationale for ERR5RS Records</a></h2>

<p>
The ERR5RS syntactic layer described by this SRFI
is based upon the
Rees/Curtis/Duba/Flatt/Krishnamurthi/Kelsey/SRFI-9
tradition, changing only a few details to improve
interoperability with records defined by the ERR5RS
and R6RS procedural layers.
</p>

<p>
The <code>define-record-type</code> syntax specified by
this SRFI is compatible with and extends SRFI 9, which
is one of the more widely accepted SRFIs.
The extensions include single inheritance and (optional)
implicit naming, along with succinct abbreviations for
specifying whether a field is immutable or mutable.
</p>

<p>
The procedural layer specified by this SRFI is fully
compatible with its <code>define-record-type</code> syntax.
Both the procedural and syntactic layers can define new
record types that inherit from previously defined record
types without requiring programmers to know which layer
was used to define the parent type.
</p>

<p>
In implementations of the R6RS, a SRFI 99 record type
coincides with the R6RS notion of a record-type descriptor.
Portable libraries can safely export SRFI 99 record types
even if they were defined using the syntactic layer of
SRFI 99.
</p>

<p>
In procedure names, SRFI 99 uses <code>rtd</code> as
an abbreviation for record-type descriptor.  This naming
convention prevents name clashes between SRFI 99 and the
R6RS procedural and inspection layers, which makes it
easier for R6RS programs to import SRFI 99 libraries.
R6RS programs must take care when importing the R6RS
syntactic layer, however, because that library's exports
conflict with both SRFI 9 and with SRFI 99.
</p>

<p>
When implemented properly, SRFI 99 records will be just
as efficient as R6RS records.  SRFI 99 is simpler than
R6RS records, both in specification and in implementation.
SRFI 99 is strictly less powerful than the R6RS records
facility because SRFI 99 does not require implementations
to provide sealed, opaque, or non-generative records.
On the other hand, SRFI 99 describes three optional
extensions (the <code>sealed</code>, <code>opaque</code>,
and <code>uid</code> arguments to <code>make-rtd</code>)
that would give SRFI 99 the same power as R6RS records.
With those three extensions, SRFI 99 would become a simple
and efficient foundation for implementing R6RS records.
</p>

<p>
The record system described by this SRFI has been
implemented in Larceny.  It is the primary record
system used by Larceny's implementation of the R6RS,
including the <code>(rnrs records syntactic)</code>
library.  Larceny demonstrates both the efficiency
of ERR5RS records and the ease of interoperability
between SRFI 9, ERR5RS, and the procedural and
inspection layers of R6RS records.

<div>
<ul>
<li>ERR5RS records support single inheritance.</li>
<li>ERR5RS records do not support the non-generative
    feature of R6RS records.
    (To show how SRFI 99 could be extended to provide
    all useful features of R6RS records, 
    SRFI 99 describes an optional extension for
    non-generativity, and the reference implementation shows

<li>ERR5RS records do not support the optional "sealed"

    (To show how SRFI 99 could be extended to provide

    </li>

    </li>
<li>ERR5RS records do not support the record-constructor
    descriptors of R6RS records.
    (Even so, ERR5RS
    records are compatible with the
    <code>make-record-constructor-descriptor</code>
    procedure of the R6RS.  Larceny, for example, allows that
    procedure to be used with ERR5RS record type descriptors.)
    </li>
<li>ERR5RS records support the per-field
    mutable/immutable feature of R6RS records.
    </li>
<li>The <code>define-record-type</code> syntax provides
    succinct defaults for both immutable and mutable fields.
    An identifier-only field spec implies immutability.
    When enclosed within parentheses, a single identifier
    implies mutability.
    </li>
<li>ERR5RS records are partitioned into a procedural layer,
    an inspection layer, and a syntactic layer.
    (The primary reason for separating the procedural layer
    from the inspection layer is to simplify comparisons
    with R6RS records.)
    </li>
<li>The <code>make-rtd</code> procedure accepts a vector of
    field specifiers instead of a list of field specifiers.
    (This is carried over from the corresponding procedure
    of the R6RS procedural layer.)
    </li>
</ul>
</div>


<h1><a name="Specification">Specification</a></h1>

<p>
All implementations of SRFI 99 must provide the
following libraries:
</p>

<pre>
    (srfi :99)                       ; alias for (srfi :99 records)
    (srfi :99 records)               ; composite of the next three
    (srfi :99 records procedural)
    (srfi :99 records inspection)
    (srfi :99 records syntactic)
</pre>

<p>
Implementations of ERR5RS should provide the following aliases
as well:
</p>

<pre>
    (err5rs records)                 ; alias for (srfi :99 records)
    (err5rs records procedural)      ; alias for (srfi :99 records procedural)
    (err5rs records inspection)      ; alias for (srfi :99 records inspection)
    (err5rs records syntactic)       ; alias for (srfi :99 records syntactic)
</pre>

<p>
The specification also describes how Scheme's standard
equivalence predicates behave with respect to records,
and shows how some R6RS examples can be translated to
use the ERR5RS libraries instead.
</p>

<p>
When the following specification says that a procedure
is said to be equivalent to some R6RS procedure, the
equivalence holds only when all arguments have the
properties required of them by the R6RS specification.
Neither ERR5RS nor this SRFI mandate the R6RS exception semantics
for programs that violate the specification.
</p>



<h2>
<a name="ProceduralLayer">Procedural Layer</a>
</h2>

<p>
The <code>(srfi :99 records procedural)</code> library
exports the following procedures.
</p>

<p><code>(make-rtd <i>name</i> <i>fieldspecs</i>)</code></p>
<p><code>(make-rtd <i>name</i> <i>fieldspecs</i> <i>parent</i>)</code></p>

<p>
<i>name</i> is a symbol, which matters only to the
<code>rtd-name</code> procedure of the inspection layer.
<i>fieldspecs</i> is a vector of field specifiers, where
each field specifier is one of
</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>a symbol naming the (mutable) field;</li>
<li>a list of the form <code>(mutable <i>name</i>)</code>,
    where <i>name</i> is a symbol naming the mutable field;</li>
<li>a list of the form <code>(immutable <i>name</i>)</code>,
    where <i>name</i> is a symbol naming the immutable field.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The optional <i>parent</i> is an rtd or <code>#f</code>.
It is an error for any of the symbols in <i>fieldspecs</i> to
name more than one of the fields specified by <i>fieldspecs</i>,
but the field names in <i>fieldspecs</i> may shadow field names
in the <i>parent</i> record-type.
</p>

<p>
Implementations may wish to extend this procedure to support
the non-generative, sealed, and/or opaque features of the R6RS.
The recommended way to support those features is to allow any
combination of the following arguments to follow the optional
<i>parent</i> argument:
</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The symbol <code>sealed</code> means the new rtd cannot
    be used as the parent of other rtds.</li>
<li>The symbol <code>opaque</code> means the <code>record?</code>
    predicate will not recognize instances of the new rtd.</li>
<li>The symbol <code>uid</code>, following by another symbol
    <i>id</i>, means the new rtd is non-generative with uid <i>id</i>.
    The semantics of this extension is the same as described by the
    R6RS.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
The recommendation above is not binding on implementations of SRFI 99.
There are other ways to realize sealed, opaque, or non-generative rtds.
</p>

<p>
Returns an R6RS-compatible record-type descriptor.
Could be defined (without the recommended error
checking, and without the extensions described above)
in terms of the R6RS procedural layer by
</p>
<div>
<pre>

      (make-record-type-descriptor
       name
       (if (null? rest) #f (car rest))
       #f #f #f

If no <i>fieldspecs</i> argument is supplied, then

that expects one argument for each field of the

instance of that record-type with its fields
initialized to the corresponding arguments.

fields initialized to the corresponding arguments.
</p><p>It is an error if some symbol occurs more than once
in <i>fieldspecs</i>.  Fields of a derived record-type
shadow fields of the same name in its parent; the

The syntactic layer consists of SRFI 9 extended with

<p>
All ERR5RS record-type definitions are generative,
but ERR5RS drops the SRFI 9 restriction to top level,
mainly because the R6RS allows generative definitions
wherever a definition may appear.

<p>
The semantics of a record type definition is the same
as in SRFI 9: the record type definition macro-expands
into a cluster of definitions that
</p>

<ul>
<li>define the <code>&lt;type name&gt;</code> as the
    record-type descriptor for the new record-type;
</li>
<li>defines a constructor for instances of the new
    record-type (unless the constructor spec is <code>#f</code>);
</li>
<li>defines a predicate that recognizes instances of the
    new record-type and its subtypes (unless the predicate
    spec is <code>#f</code>);
</li>
<li>defines an accessor for each field name;
</li>
<li>defines a mutator for each mutable field name.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
An ERR5RS record type definition extends SRFI 9 with the
following additional options:
</p>

<ul>
<li>If a <code>&lt;parent&gt;</code> expression is specified,
then it must evaluate to an rtd that serves as the parent
record-type for the record-type being defined.
</li>
<li>If <code>#f</code> is specified for the constructor or
predicate, then no constructor or predicate procedure is defined.
(This is useful when the record-type being defined will be used
as an abstract base class.)
</li>
<li>If <code>#t</code> is specified for the constructor or
predicate, then the name of the constructor is the type name
prefixed by <code>make-</code>, and the name of the predicate
is the type name followed by a question mark (<code>?</code>).
</li>
<li>If the constructor name is specified as <code>#t</code> or
as an identifier, then the constructor's arguments correspond
to the fields of the parent (if any) followed by the new fields
added by this record-type definition.
</li>
<li>If a field spec consists of a single identifier, then
    <ul>
    <li>the field is immutable;
    </li>
    <li>the name of its accessor is the type name followed by a
    hyphen (<code>-</code>) followed by the field name.
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>If a field spec consists of a list of one identifier, then
    <ul>
    <li>the field is mutable;
    </li>
    <li>the name of its accessor is the type name followed by a
        hyphen (<code>-</code>) followed by the field name;
    </li>
    <li>the name of its mutator is the type name followed by a
        hyphen (<code>-</code>) followed by the field name
        followed by <code>-set!</code>.

includes two extended examples that provide a nice comparison of
the R6RS and ERR5RS record systems, especially since these two
examples were designed to highlight the use of R6RS
record-constructor descriptors in combination with inheritance.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="Example1">Example 1</a>
</h2>

<p>
Using ERR5RS records, the first example becomes:
</p>

<pre>
(define rtd1
  (make-rtd 'rtd1 '#((immutable x1) (immutable x2))))

(define rtd2
  (make-rtd 'rtd2 '#((immutable x3) (immutable x4)) rtd1))

(define rtd3
  (make-rtd 'rtd3 '#((immutable x5) (immutable x6)) rtd2))

(define protocol1
  (lambda (p)
    (lambda (a b c)
      (p (+ a b) (+ b c)))))

(define protocol2
  (lambda (n)
    (lambda (a b c d e f)
      (let ((p (n a b c)))
        (p (+ d e) (+ e f))))))

(define protocol3
  (lambda (n)
    (lambda (a b c d e f g h i)
      (let ((p (n a b c d e f)))
        (p (+ g h) (+ h i))))))

(define make-rtd1
  (protocol1 (rtd-constructor rtd1)))

(define make-rtd2
  (let ((maker2 (rtd-constructor rtd2)))
    (protocol2
     (protocol1
      (lambda (x1 x2)
        (lambda (x3 x4)
          (maker2 x1 x2 x3 x4)))))))

(define make-rtd3
  (let ((maker3 (rtd-constructor rtd3)))
    (protocol3
     (protocol2
      (protocol1
       (lambda (x1 x2)
         (lambda (x3 x4)
           (lambda (x5 x6)
             (maker3 x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6)))))))))

(make-rtd3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)

; evaluates to a record whose fields contain
; 3 5 9 11 15 17
</pre>

<p>
The purpose of the R6RS record-constructor descriptors is to
automate the idiom shown in the definitions of
<code>make-rtd1</code>, <code>make-rtd2</code>,
and <code>make-rtd3</code> above, and to provide an alternative
to procedural abstraction when eliminating the duplication of
code seen in <code>make-point/abs</code> and
<code>make-cpoint/abs</code> below.
