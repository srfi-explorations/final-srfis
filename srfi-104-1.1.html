<h1><a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h1>

<p>This SRFI implements <a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-103/srfi-103.html">
SRFI 103: Library Files</a> as a library.  It may be used as the means for Scheme
implementations to support SRFI 103; in which case, the dynamically configurable
aspects of this SRFI are the configuration of SRFI 103; which makes the
configuration of SRFI 103 dynamically reconfigurable and inspectable by users.  If
this SRFI is not used by Scheme implementations as the means to support SRFI 103,
it is still useful for building upon to create software for managing library
files and for users working with library files.  A reference implementation is
provided.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<h1><a name="rationale">Rationale</a></h1>

<p><a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-103/srfi-103.html">SRFI 103: Library
Files</a> only defines a standard for naming and finding library files.  To
assist in working with library files as defined by SRFI 103, and to assist Scheme
implementations in supporting SRFI 103, this SRFI provides a library API of
procedures and parameters for working with and configuring all the aspects of
SRFI 103.  E.g., a Scheme implementation can use this SRFI as its primary means of
importing external libraries.  Or, e.g., a library manager application can use
this SRFI to do transcoding of path names when exchanging library files between
different file systems, or to work with library files in other ways.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<h1><a name="specification">Specification</a></h1>

<p>Implementations of this SRFI as an R6RS-like library must be named
<code>(srfi :104 library-files-utilities)</code>, and there must also be an alias
named <code>(srfi :104)</code>, following
<a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-97/srfi-97.html">
SRFI 97: SRFI Libraries</a>.</p>

<p>This specification refers to many aspects of 
<a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-103/srfi-103.html">SRFI 103: Library Files</a>,
and familiarity with it is assumed.</p>

<h3><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-39/srfi-39.html">
SRFI 39: Parameter Objects</a></p>

<h3><a name="bindings">Provided Bindings</a></h3>

<dl>
<dt><a name="implementation-name-def">
    <span class="type">PARAMETER</span>
    <b>implementation-name</b></a></dt>
<dd><p>The name to use as the implementation-specific component of the file name
extension.  It must be a non-empty string which is the non-encoded name.  Its
encoded form is used to add or recognize the component.  The four special
characters of SRFI 103, <code>#\0</code> through <code>#\9</code>, and any
characters <code>encode-char?</code> returns true for are encoded.  This
parameter must be initialized to the name of the host implementation.</p>

<p>If this SRFI is used as the means for the host implementation to support SRFI
103, changing the value of this parameter will dynamically reconfigure the
implementation name used by SRFI 103.  If this SRFI is not used as the means for
the host implementation to support SRFI 103, changing the value of this parameter
will not affect the implementation name used by SRFI 103.</p></dd>


<dt><a name="path-separator-def">
    <span class="type">PARAMETER</span>
    <b>path-separator</b></a></dt>
<dd><p>The character used by the host platform to separate components in paths.
It is used to join or split components of paths.  It is encoded in components of
relative library file paths.  It must be a character, and it must not
be <code>#\%</code>, <code>#\.</code>, <code>#\^</code>, or the same as the
value of <code>environment-variable-separator</code>.  This parameter must be
initialized to the host platform's path separator character.</p>

<p>If this SRFI is used as the means for the host implementation to support SRFI
103, changing the value of this parameter will dynamically reconfigure the path
separator used by SRFI 103.  If this SRFI is not used as the means for the host
implementation to support SRFI 103, changing the value of this parameter will not
affect the path separator used by SRFI 103.</p></dd>


<dt><a name="environment-variable-separator-def">
    <span class="type">PARAMETER</span>
    <b>environment-variable-separator</b></a></dt>
<dd><p>The character used by the host platform to separate paths in the
<code>SCHEME_LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS</code> environment variable.  It must be a
character, and it must not be the same as the value of
<code>path-separator</code>.  This parameter must be initialized to the host
platform's environment variable separator character.</p>

<p>If this SRFI is used as the means for the host implementation to support SRFI
103, changing the value of this parameter will dynamically reconfigure the
environment variable separator used by SRFI 103.  If this SRFI is not used as the
means for the host implementation to support SRFI 103, changing the value of this
parameter will not affect the environment variable separator used by SRFI 103.
Note that SRFI 103 uses its environment variable separator only once when
initializing its search paths.</p></dd>


<dt><a name="search-paths-def">
    <span class="type">PARAMETER</span>
    <b>search-paths</b></a></dt>
<dd><p>The list of names of directories to search for library files, in order of
precedence.  It must be a list, possibly empty, of paths which must be
independent, i.e., one cannot be a prefix of another.  This parameter must be
initialized to the host implementation's search paths.</p>

<p>If this SRFI is used as the means for the host implementation to support SRFI
103, changing the value of this parameter will dynamically reconfigure the search
paths used by SRFI 103.  If this SRFI is not used as the means for the host
implementation to support SRFI 103, changing the value of this parameter will not
affect the search paths used by SRFI 103.</p>

<dl><dt>Examples:</dt>
       <dd><table>
           <tr><td>OK:</td>
               <td><pre>(search-paths '("." "asdf/fdsa" "/foo/bar/blah" "/foo/bar/zab"))</pre></td></tr>

<dt><a name="directory-list-def">
    <span class="type">PARAMETER</span>
    <b>directory-list</b></a></dt>
<dd><p>The procedure which lists directories.  It is used when finding library
files.  It must be a procedure which takes a path naming a directory and returns
a list, possibly empty, of strings which are the relative names of the entities
in the directory.  The procedure must return <code>#F</code> if the directory
does not exist, so that the search may continue.  The procedure may raise an
exception if there is any problem listing the directory (e.g., "not a directory"
or "permission denied"), or it may return <code>#F</code> to ignore the problem
and allow the search to continue.  This parameter must be initialized to a
procedure which lists directories as described.</p>

<p>If this SRFI is used as the means for the host implementation to support SRFI
103, changing the value of this parameter will dynamically reconfigure the means
of listing directories used by SRFI 103.  If this SRFI is not used as the means
for the host implementation to support SRFI 103, changing the value of this
parameter will not affect the means of listing directories used by SRFI
103.</p></dd>


<dt><a name="encode-charp-def">
    <span class="type">PARAMETER</span>
    <b>encode-char?</b></a></dt>
<dd><p>The predicate which determines what additional characters to encode in
components of relative library file paths.  It must be a procedure which takes a
character and returns true or <code>#F</code>; true means the character will be
encoded, <code>#F</code> means it will not be.  It cannot determine whether the
special characters <code>#\%</code>, <code>#\.</code>, <code>#\^</code>, and the
value of <code>path-separator</code> are encoded because they are always
encoded.  If an appropriate set of characters to encode for the host platform's
file system can be determined, this parameter must be initialized to a
procedure which indicates to encode these.  If this cannot be determined, its
default value is a procedure which always returns <code>#F</code>.</p>

<p>If this SRFI is used as the means for the host implementation to support SRFI
103, changing the value of this parameter will dynamically reconfigure the
additional characters encoded by SRFI 103.  If this SRFI is not used as the means
for the host implementation to support SRFI 103, changing the value of this
parameter will not affect the additional characters encoded by SRFI 103.</p></dd>


<dt><a name="search-paths-from-environment-variable-def">
    <span class="type">PROCEDURE</span>
    (<b>search-paths-from-environment-variable</b>)</a></dt>
<dd><p>Returns a list, possibly empty, of strings which are the paths from the
current value of the <code>SCHEME_LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS</code> environment
variable at the time the procedure is called, in the same order they occured in
the environment variable.  The character used to separate paths in the
environment variable is the current value of
<code>environment-variable-separator</code>.  Empty elements (e.g., caused
by <code>"a/b::c/d"</code>, <code>":a/b"</code>, etc.) are filtered out.  If the
environment variable is not defined, <code>'()</code> is returned.</p></dd>

7.1</a>), return a string which is a relative library file path which represents
the library name and can be used as the name of a file containing a library with
the given library name.  The sequence of symbols in the library name are encoded
to make the leading path components.  If the second argument is true, a last
path component with prefix <code>"^main^"</code> is implicitly appended.  If the
third argument is true, the file name extension of the last path component is
prepended with the encoded form of the current value of
<code>implementation-name</code>.  When encoding the library name's symbols and
the implementation name, the current value of <code>encode-char?</code>
determines what characters are encoded in addition to the characters which are
always encoded.  The current value of <code>path-separator</code> is used to
construct the returned path.</p>

association list of information about the path, else return <code>#F</code>.
This can be used as a predicate to recognize library file paths versus other
paths.  One association is always present: key <code>'library</code> and value
being the library name decoded from the path.  If the path begins with one of

reference, and return an association list describing the matching paths and
their ordering.  Each association represents a search path which contains at

represents.  The associations are ordered the same as their keys are in
the <code>search-paths</code> parameter.  The value of each association is a
list of length one or two which represents the one or two possible directories
in the association's search path which contain matches.  A directory containing
implicit file names is one of the possibilities, and a directory containing
non-implicit file names is the other possibility.  If both directories exist and
contain matches, the directory containing implicit file names is ordered first.
Each element of this list is a non-empty ordered list of matching paths from the

<h1><a name="reference-implementation">Reference Implementation</a></h1>

<p>The reference implementation is provided as an R6RS library.  It requires a
directory listing procedure, a number of R6RS bindings, 
<a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-39/srfi-39.html"> SRFI 39: Parameter
Objects</a>, and <a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-98/srfi-98.html">SRFI
98: An Interface to Access Environment Variables</a>.  It can be used by Scheme
implementations as a built-in library, e.g., in a boot image.  It can also be
used as an externally-imported library.</p>

<p>For use as an externally-imported library, the reference implementation uses
implementation-specific library files in order to initialize the parameters of
this SRFI.  Files are provided for Ikarus, Larceny, PLT, and Ypsilon, and these
files should make it clear how other implementations can be supported.  If this
SRFI is built-in to a Scheme implementation, the implementation-specific
libraries are not needed and the main library can be easily adapted to not use
them.</p>

<p>The test program is provided as an R6RS program.  It requires, in addition to
an implementation of this SRFI, 
<a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-39/srfi-39.html"> 
SRFI 39: Parameter Objects</a>, and 
<a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-78/srfi-78.html">
SRFI 78: Lightweight Testing</a>.</p>

   The reference implementation and tests.</a></p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<h1><a name="issues">Issues</a></h1>

<p>(Section which points out things to be resolved.  This will not appear in the
final SRFI.)</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Are the initialization helper libraries all correct and as complete as
  they should be?</p></li>

  <li><p>Should <code>find-library-file-paths</code> return a joined and
  flattened list, and get rid of
  <code>join-and-flatten</code>, instead?
  <code>library-file-path-info</code> can be used on the paths to know
  their search path, etc.</p></li>

  <li><p>How should absolute paths which aren't prefixed with a search path be
  interpreted?:</p>
  <pre>
(parameterize ((search-paths '()))
  (library-file-path-info "/a/b/c/foo.sls"))
=&gt; #F or ((library . (a b c foo))) ???
(parameterize ((path-separator #\\)
               (search-paths '()))
  (library-file-path-info "C:\\a\\b\\c\\foo.sls"))
=&gt; ???</pre>
  <p>Relative paths are OK because it makes sense to use all the components:</p>
  <pre>
(parameterize ((search-paths '()))
  (library-file-path-info "a/b/c/foo.sls"))
=&gt; ((library . (a b c foo)))</pre></li>

  <li><p>What should be done about this absolute vs. relative path bug?:</p>
  <pre>
(parameterize ((search-paths '("/a/b/c")))
  (library-file-path-info "a/b/c/foo.sls"))
=&gt; ((library . (foo)))  ;; should be ((library . (a b c foo)))
(parameterize ((search-paths '("a/b/c")))
  (library-file-path-info "/a/b/c/foo.sls"))
=&gt; ((library . (foo)))  ;; should it be #F,
                        ;; or should it be ((library . (a b c foo)))?</pre>
  <p>A <code>substring</code> and <code>string=?</code> could easily be done
  instead, but then this would not work:</p>
  <pre>
(parameterize ((search-paths '("/a/b/c")))
  (library-file-path-info "//a///b////c/////foo.sls"))
=&gt; ((library . (foo))
    (search-path . "/a/b/c"))
(parameterize ((search-paths '("//a///b////c")))
  (library-file-path-info "/a/b/c/foo.sls"))
=&gt; ((library . (foo))
    (search-path . "//a///b////c"))</pre>
  <p>Some sort of smarter path splitting and joining is needed.  A first
  <code>"/"</code> could be considered both a component and a separator, but
  then what would be the ramifications to non-POSIX path support?  We want to
  support the ability to use different path types at run-time (via
  parameterization).  Make some path type parameter..?  Incorporate path
  normalization..?  I wish a suitable path manipulation SRFI existed...</p></li>

  <li><p>TODO: Anything else?</p></li>
</ul>
