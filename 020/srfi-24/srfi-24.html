<H1>Abstract</H1>

<p>This document specifies a proper extension to Scheme which allows
<b>define-syntax</b> forms to appear in those places where local
definitions can appear (R5RS, 5.2.2). A corresponding letrec-variant
is described.

<H1>Issues</H1>

<p>None yet...

<H1>Rationale</H1>

<p>Local lexical scopes are often used to hide internal data.  Module
and object systems have been built on the idea of hiding internal
state into a local lexical scope.  R5RS explicitly prohibits
<b>define-syntax</b> from appearing in local scopes (R5RS, 5.3).  This
gives to the top-level environment more syntactical power than to the
local scopes, because on the top-level it is possible to create a
mutually recursive pair of a procedure and a macro, whereas in local
scopes it cannot be done conveniently.  It is shown in this document
that a simple transformation exists that can be used to mimic this
behaviour in local scopes.  The aim of this SRFI is to make this
transformation explicit and give it a name, namely,
<b>define-syntax</b>. A partial reference implementation is provided;
full implementation requires system-specific features.

<H1>Specification</H1>

<p>The following productions are added to the syntax of Scheme (R5RS, 7.1)

<blockquote>
<p>  &lt;definition&gt; -&gt;  &lt;syntax-definition&gt; <br>
<p>  &lt;derived expression&gt; -&gt;
  (<b>letrec-mixed</b>
     (&lt;syntax spec&gt;*)
     (&lt;binding spec&gt;*) &lt;body&gt;)
</blockquote>

<p>The restriction that <b>define-syntax</b> cannot appear in a local
scope is lifted (R5RS, 5.3).  Instead, <b>define-syntax</b> can appear
wherever a local definition of a value can.

<p>The following equivalence is used to describe <b>letrec-mixed</b>.
#unspecified denotes an undefined value:

<pre>
(<b>letrec-mixed</b> ((macro-name transformer) ...)
              ((variable init) ...)
   body body2 ...)

=

(let ((variable #unspecified) ...)
  (<b>letrec-syntax</b> ((macro-name transformer) ...)
    (set! variable init) ...
    body body2 ...))
</pre>

More precisely, the order in which the variables receive their real
values is unspecified in the manner as for letrec (R5RS, 7.3).  Every
init expression must be able to evaluate without making a reference to
the other bound (run-time) variables. Every macro transformer is
defined in the scope in which the bound variables are defined, and the
initializing expressions as well as the body sequence are
macro-expanded in a scope where the defined macros are visible.  So
the macros and the init-expressions can be mutually recursive.

<p>It is an error for any symbol to appear in both the list of
macro-names and variables.

<p>The description of internal definitions (R5RS, 5.2.2) is changed to
be given in the terms of <b>letrec-mixed</b>: A body containing
internal definitions and internal syntax definitions can be converted
into a completely equivalent <b>letrec-mixed</b> expression.  For
example,

<pre>
(let ((x 5))
  (<b>define-syntax</b> foo
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((foo y) (bar x y))))
  (define bar (lambda (a b) (+ (* a b) a)))
  (foo (+ x 3))) ==> 45
</pre>

is equivalent to

<pre>
(let ((x 5))
  (<b>letrec-mixed</b> ((foo (syntax-rules ()
                        ((foo y) (bar x y)))))
                ((bar (lambda (a b) (+ (* a b) a))))
    (foo (+ x 3))))
</pre>

<!-- <h2>Notes</h2>

<font size=-1>

Because <b>letrec-syntax</b> and the variants create new lexical
scopes, it is not possible to capture a local macro and use it outside
its lexical scope.  The following example thus is not a valid
expression:

<pre>
(let ()
  (<b>let-syntax</b> ((x ...))
    (<b>define-syntax</b> y (syntax-rules () (... (... (x ...) ...)))))
  (y ...))
</pre>

Unfortunately, there is no syntactic counter-part to

<pre>
(let ()
  (define y
    (let ((x ...))
      ... x ...))
  ...)
</pre>

which is still a defect.  If another SRFI later is used to extend
<b>define-syntax</b> to allow to capture macros defined with
<b>letrec-syntax</b> and the variants, then the author makes a
provision that the same behaviour should be extended to local
<b>define-syntax</b>es on systems that support them.

<p>In this kind of a hypothetical Scheme environment, thus,
the syntax example above would be valid, and would correspond to

<pre>
(let ()
  (<b>define-syntax</b> ((x* ...))
  (<b>define-syntax</b> y (syntax-rules () (... (... (x* ...) ...)))))
  (y ...))
</pre>

where x* is a freshly generated (= alpha-converted) symbol.

<H1>Implementation</H1>

The following reference implementation represents the idea but is not
full implementation.  The author believes strongly that a complete
implementation is impossible to write by using the macro system of
R5RS alone.  The problem here is that in order to make the process of
expanding internal definitions visible, the keyword lambda must be
redefined.  However, the new expansion of lambda must refer to the
original definition of lambda.  Therefore <b>define-syntax</b> cannot
be used to rebind lambda, so we need to resort to describing the
effect upon a single expression E by putting it inside a series of
<b>let-syntax</b>es and <b>letrec-syntax</b>es.  Also, all derived
forms must be redefined to use the new lambda form.  The place for
this is denoted below but the details are omitted.  Moreover, only
literally appearing begin, define and <b>define-syntax</b> forms are
recognized.  If a macro expands to begin, define or
<b>define-syntax</b> form the expansion of internal definitions stops
[although R5RS is not completely clear on whether allowing internal
definitions as results of macro expansion is mandatory].

<p>This being explained, let E be a Scheme expression.  The effects of
the extension above can be implemented by (<b>letrec-mixed</b>
incorrectly fixes evaluation order):

<pre>
(<b>define-syntax</b> <b>letrec-mixed</b>
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((letrec-mixed ((?s ?d) ...) ((?v ?e) ...) ?b ?b2 ...)
     (let ((?v #f) ...)
       (<b>letrec-syntax</b> ((?s ?d) ...)
	 (set! ?v ?e) ...
	 ?b ?b2 ...)))))
</pre>

<pre>
(<b>letrec-syntax</b>
    ((expand-internal-definitions
      (syntax-rules (begin define <b>define-syntax</b>)

	((expand-internal-definitions ?syntaxes ?values
	    (begin ?expr ...) ?later ...)
	 (expand-internal-definitions
	  ?syntaxes ?values
	  ?expr ... ?later ...))

	((expand-internal-definitions ?syntaxes ?values
	    (define (?variable . ?args) ?body ?body2 ...) ?later ...)
	 (expand-internal-definitions
	  ?syntaxes ?values
	  (define ?variable (lambda ?args ?body ?body2 ...))
	  ?later ...))

	((expand-internal-definitions ?syntaxes ?values
                                      (define ?variable ?value) ?later ...)
	 (expand-internal-definitions
	  ?syntaxes
	  ((?variable ?value) . ?values)
	  ?later ...))

	((expand-internal-definitions ?syntaxes ?values
            (<b>define-syntax</b> ?macro ?expansion) ?later ...)
	 (expand-internal-definitions
	  ((?macro ?expansion) . ?syntaxes)
	  ?values
	  ?later ...))

	((expand-internal-definitions ((?macro ?expansion) ...)
	    ((?variable ?value) ...)
	    ?other ...)
	 (<b>letrec-mixed</b> ((?macro ?expansion) ...)
		       ((?variable ?value) ...)
	    ?other ...)))))
  (<b>let-syntax</b>
      ((lambda
	   (syntax-rules ()
	     ((lambda ?args ?body ?body2 ...)
	      (lambda ?args
		(expand-internal-definitions () () ?body ?body2 ...))))))
      (<b>letrec-syntax</b> REDEFINE DERIVED FORMS ...
         E)))
</pre>

<p> This has been tested to work on <a
href="http://www.scheme.com/">Petite Scheme</a>.

Here is an example that has mutually recursive
macros and procedures:

<pre>
(let ()
  (define (x n)
    (if (> n 0) (+ 1 (call-y (- n 1))) 0))
  (define (y n)
    (if (> n 0) (* 2 (call-x-indirectly (- n 1))) 1))
  (<b>define-syntax</b> call-x-indirectly
    (syntax-rules () ((_ arg ...) (call-x arg ...))))
  (<b>define-syntax</b> call-x
    (syntax-rules () ((_ arg ...) (x arg ...))))
  (<b>define-syntax</b> call-y
    (syntax-rules () ((_ arg ...) (y arg ...))))
  (call-x 10)) ==> 31
</pre>

<p> On a conforming implementation the expression evaluates to 31,
and is completely equivalent to

<pre>
(let ()
  (define (x n) (if (> n 0) (+ 1 (y (- n 1))) 0))
  (define (y n) (if (> n 0) (* 2 (x (- n 1))) 1))
  (x 10))
</pre>

<h2>Note on set!-free implementations</h2>

<p>A Scheme implementation can prefer to implement the expansion of
letrec without employing set!. The expansion of <b>letrec-mixed</b> is
also easy to describe in terms of alpha-conversion and (conceptually)
created environment frames.  The standard letrec-form

<pre>
(letrec ((v e) ...) b b2 ...)
</pre>

<p>can be though to work as follows: every variable v is
alpha-converted to v* inside all the e's and the bodies.  Upon
run-time, an environment frame (a set of locations) is created when
the evaluation of letrec starts, and the alpha-converted variables v*
denote each one slot in this frame.  The frame contains originally
undefined values.  The initializing expressions e are evaluated in
some order and the resulting values are written to the environment
frame.  If a reference to the frame is made such that the initial,
undefined value is returned, an error occurs.

<p>Then

<pre>
(<b>letrec-mixed</b> ((m x) ...) ((v e) ...) b b2 ...)
</pre>

can be described by first performing the alpha-conversion of v's to
v*'s inside x's, e's and the bodies.  After that, the form is handled
by macro-expanding the e's and bodies by applying the alpha-converted
macro expanders.
