<h1>Abstract</h1><p>This SRFI describes basic prerequisites for running Scheme programs
as Unix scripts in a uniform way.  Specifically, it describes:</p><ul><li>the syntax of Unix scripts written in Scheme,</li><li>a uniform convention for calling the Scheme script
     interpreter, and</li><li>a method for accessing the Unix command line arguments from
     within the Scheme script.</li></ul><h1>Rationale</h1><p>A user, given a Scheme program, has no standard way of running
it, even if it is a single file written in R5RS-conformant Scheme, and
if the underlying platform is known to be Unix.  Almost every Scheme
implementation provides an executable capable of starting up the Scheme
system and load a particular file, but
few pairs of Scheme implementation exist which share a convention for
this.</p><p>This lack of de-facto standardization makes it impossible
to write even a simple end-user program without also shipping a particular
Scheme implementation with it or providing elaborate implementation-specific
machinery.  This SRFI describes a set of conventions
which allow the creation of portable Unix scripts written in Scheme.</p><p>Unfortunately, the set of existing conventions among Scheme implementation makes it impossible to formulate these conventions in such a way
as to remain compatible with all existing solutions to the
problem.  The <a href="#design rationale">Design Rationale</a> section gives a brief
overview.</p><h1>Specification</h1><h3>Script Syntax</h3><pre>&lt;script&gt; --&gt; &lt;script prelude&gt;? &lt;program&gt;
&lt;script prelude&gt; --&gt; #! &lt;space&gt; &lt;any character that isn't a line break&gt;* &lt;line break&gt;</pre><p>The <code>&lt;script prelude&gt;</code> line may not be longer than
64 characters.  (See <a href="#sixtyfour">here</a> for a rationale.)</p><h3>Script Interpreter Invocation</h3><p>Systems supporting this SRFI provide a selection of binary executables
called <em>Scheme script interpreters</em> depending on the language dialects they support.  They 
provide any of <code>scheme-r<i>n</i>rs</code>, <code>scheme-ieee-<i>n</i>-<i>y</i></code>, <code>scheme-srfi-0</code>, and <code>scheme-srfi-7</code> in the regular path.  The invocation syntax for these interpreters
is always as follows:<pre>&lt;executable&gt; &lt;file&gt; &lt;argument&gt; ...</pre></p><p>It is recommended that the Scheme script interpreter resides somewhere
in the standard Unix path.  Moreover, the recommended way to invoke
the Scheme script interpreter from the script is via a <code>/usr/bin/env</code> trampoline, like this:</p><pre>#! /usr/bin/env &lt;executable&gt;</pre><h3>Semantics</h3><p>A Scheme script interpreter loads the file specified by <code>&lt;file&gt;</code>.  It ignores the script prelude and interprets the rest of
the file according to the language dialect specified by the name
of the interpreter.</p><p>The Scheme script interpreter may also load a different file
after making a reasonable check that loading it is semantically
equivalent to loading <code>&lt;file&gt;</code>.  For example, the script interpreter may assume that
a file with a related name (say, with an additional extension) is a
compiled version of <code>&lt;file&gt;</code>.  (See also <a href="#compilability">below</a> under "Compilability".)</p><p><code>scheme-r<i>n</i>rs</code> expects code written in R<i>n</i>RS Scheme. <code>scheme-ieee-<i>n</i>-<i>y</i></code> expects code written in IEEE <i>n</i>-<i>y</i> Scheme. Specifically, <code>scheme-r4rs</code> expects code written in R4RS Scheme, <code>scheme-r5rs</code> expects code written in R5RS Scheme, and <code>scheme-ieee-1178-1990</code> expects code written in IEEE 1178-1990 Scheme. <code>scheme-srfi-0</code> expects code written in R5RS Scheme using the extensions specified in <a href="../srfi-0">SRFI 0</a>. <code>scheme-srfi-7</code> expects code written in R5RS Scheme using the extensions specified in <a href="../srfi-7">SRFI 7</a>. </p><p>Upon invocation of a script, the Scheme system calls a procedure named <code>main</code> with one argument,
a list of strings containing the Unix command-line arguments <em>to the script</em>, i.e. the
elements of the <code>argv</code> vector of the Scheme script interpreter process from index 1 on.
Thus, the first element of the list is the name of the script.</p><p>The <code>main</code> procedure should return an integer which becomes the exit status of
the script.</p><p>When, during the execution of the script, an error
is signalled (in the sense of <a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-4.html#%_sec_1.3.2">R5RS, Section 1.3.2</a>) the script returns immediately with the value of the C <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysexits&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+4.3-RELEASE&amp;format=html"><code>sysexits.h</code></a> macro <code>EX_SOFTWARE</code> as its exit status or 70, if <code>sysexits.h</code> is unavailable.</p><p>Should <code>main</code> return anything other than an integer which would be a valid
exit status, the script also returns <code>EX_SOFTWARE</code>.</p><p>In the above error situations, implementations are encouraged to
display a meaningful error message on <code>stderr</code>.</p><p>If the script interpreter allows the script access to the
environment (via a future SRFI yet to be written), the environment
seen by the script must be identical to that of the script
interpreter upon its invocation.</p><p>A Scheme implementation supporting this SRFI
does not have to provide all of these script interpreters.
However, Scheme
implementations are encouraged to provide <code>scheme-ieee-1178-1990</code> if they implement IEEE 1178-1990 or R5RS, <code>scheme-ieee-<i>n</i>-<i>y</i></code> if they implement another IEEE standard for Scheme, <code>scheme-r<i>n</i>rs</code> if they implement R<i>n</i>RS for <i>n</i>&gt;=4, <code>scheme-srfi-0</code> if they implement <a href="../srfi-0">SRFI 0</a>, and <code>scheme-srfi-7</code> if they implement <a href="../srfi-7">SRFI 7</a>.</p><p>In the case of <code>scheme-srfi-7</code> all specifications of filenames (marked by <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> in the syntax of SRFI 7) are string literals containing Unix-style filenames
which are absolute or relative to the directory the script resides in.</p><h3>Interactive Loading of Scripts</h3><p>Scheme implementations with an interactive development environment
which support SRFI 22 are encouraged to also support loading Scheme
scripts into that environment.</p><a name="compilability" /><h3>Compilability</h3><p>Programmers who want their scripts to be compilable to
native code are encouraged
to provide an initial invocation line of the format <pre>#! ... &lt;executable&gt;</pre></p><p><code>&lt;executable&gt;</code> is the name of one of the script interpreters from
the above list; it may carry a directory prefix such as in <code>/usr/local/bin/scheme-r5rs</code>.</p><p>It is expected that Scheme systems supporting compilation to native
executables will use the first such line appearing in a script
to determine the language dialect.</p><h1>Example</h1><p>Here is a Scheme version of the Unix <code>cat</code> utility:</p><pre>#! /usr/bin/env scheme-r5rs

(define (main arguments)
  (for-each display-file (cdr arguments))
  0)

(define (display-file filename)
  (call-with-input-file filename
    (lambda (port)
      (let loop ()
	(let ((thing (read-char port)))
	  (if (not (eof-object? thing))
	      (begin
		(write-char thing)
		(loop))))))))</pre><a name="design rationale" /><h1>Design Rationale</h1><p>Most Unix Scheme implementation support writing Unix scripts in one form 
or another.  Unfortunately, the invocation syntax as well as the syntax
of the script itself vary from one implementation for another.  However,
the design decisions for this SRFI were made with some care:</p><h3>Script Interpreters must be Binaries</h3><p>Script interpreters adhering to this SRFI must be binary
executables.  They cannot be shell scripts because that would
preclude them from being used directly in the invocation line
of the prelude: most Unix variants require the script interpreter
in the invocation line to be a binary.</p><h3>Optional Invocation Line</h3><p>The invocation line is optional to make it possible
to write scripts which are standard Scheme files, and by
invoking the Scheme script interpreter explicitly.  This could
make it possible (provided future script SRFIs for other environments
follow the example) to write, say, makefiles which are portable
among different environments.</p><h3>Absolute Script Location vs. Trampoline</h3><p>This SRFI specifies a name but not an absolute
location for the Scheme script interpreter.  Since most Unix
implementations require the interpreter in a script to be an
absolute filename, the only way to portably start 
the interpreter is by calling a standard Unix program such as <code>/usr/bin/env</code> (a so-called <em>trampoline</em>) as
shown in the example.</p><p>This is because there is no well-established convention
for the location of third-party software on Unix systems.  A convention
common on one system or in one environment might be unimplementable in
another.  Moreover, trampolines are generally <em>very</em> cheap on Unix, and it is expected that the cost
of Scheme script interpretation and execution will almost always dominate
the cost of the trampoline.</p><h3>Portability</h3><p>Portability is a relative term in the context
of this SRFI: Posix and <a href="http://www.unix-systems.org/single_unix_specification_v2/">The Single Unix Specification</a> do not guarantee
any method for automatic script execution, even though most Unix
implementations support the <code>#!</code> convention.  Moreover, neither of the two guarantees the presence
of an <code>env</code> executable in <code>/usr/bin</code>.  However, a wide range of systems do.  The discussion archive contains
logs from a number of systems.</p><a name="sixtyfour" /><p>A more pertinent portability issue is the length of the
script invocation line.  Until recently, a number of Unix variants
imposed a 32-character limit on that line.  However, this limit
seems to have been raised to 64 or disappeared
with more recent versions of most of
these systems.  (In fact, all that we tested.)
Again, the discussion archive contains more data.  Since
descriptive names for the Scheme script interpreters tend
to exceed the 32-character limit on invocation lines, the limit
it 64.</p><h3>Implicit vs. Explicit Command-Line-Parameter Access</h3><p>This SRFI specifies that the Scheme script interpreters will
communicate the command-line arguments to the script as a list argument
to the <code>main</code> procedure.
Some Scheme implementations use a special global variable that holds
the arguments.  It is not clear that one alternative is inherently
preferable to another.  Neither is it clear whether a vector or a list
is the more natural data structure.</p><p>However, explicitly specifying an entry point has the advantage
that scripts are easier to debug with a REPL-type Scheme implementation -
it is easily possible to call <code>main</code> explicitly from the REPL,
demonstrably achieving the same effect as loading the script from 
the interpreter.</p><h3>Command-Line Parameters as Arguments vs. as a Data Structure</h3><p>There were several discussions on the mailing list
about whether to pass command-line parameters as separate arguments
to the <code>main</code> procedure or in a data structure.  Both offer slight usability 
advantages depending on context.  However, passing the parameters
as separate arguments opens up a conflict between semantic correctness
("What should be the exit code of a script with an arity error in the
call to <code>main</code>?") and ease of implementation (see <a href="mail-archive/msg00098.html">this message</a> and the subsequent discussion).</p><h3>Positional Command-Line Arguments vs. Explicit Switches</h3><p>A previous draft of this SRFI required that language
dialect, entry procedure, and script filename be specified via
Unix-style command-line switches.  This requires additional
command-line parsing machinery.  Moreover, this precludes
starting the script interpreter directly instead of going through a
trampoline on Unix systems which allow only one command-line
argument to the script interpreter.</p><h3>Windows Compatibility</h3><p>It seems that Windows script syntax is fundamentally
incompatible with Unix script syntax, so it is impossible
to write a single file which will run as a script on both
Unix and Windows.  (See also <a href="mail-archive/msg00022.html">Marc Feeley's message</a> on the subject.) It is feasible to also specify an 
alternate Script syntax which will work on Windows.  However, this
is not in the scope of this SRFI.  However, Windows allows associating
an executable with a file extension which might make Unix Scheme scripts
runnable on a Windows system. (See  <a href="mail-archive/msg00023.html">Eli Barzilay's message</a> on the subject.)</p><h1>Implementation</h1><p>An implementation is necessarily very implementation-dependent.
Moreover, it should be clear that an implementation of this SRFI is not very
difficult in any Scheme implementation callable from a Unix shell.  Therefore,
this SRFI contains no reference implementation.</p>
