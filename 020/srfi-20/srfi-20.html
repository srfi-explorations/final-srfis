<H1>Abstract</H1>

This SRFI presents an object system to define classes, generic functions
as well as to support some level of introspection. This object system
is based on Meroon-V3 which is itself inspired by CLOS. <a
href="http://www-spi.lip6.fr/~queinnec/WWW/Meroon.html"> Meroon-V3</a>
is distributed and used since 1992.

<H1>Issues</H1>

There are two kinds of object models: the closed model or the open
model. The closed model comes from statically typed systems (C++,
Java, OCaml, etc.); this model is characterized by the following
dogmas: classes are encapsulation units, methods must be known at
class-definition time, there's only one receiver for a message (since
generic functions are hard to type). This model has good compilation
properties since most types are known at compile-time.
<p>
The open model is more dynamic (CLOS, <a
href="http://www-spi.lip6.fr/~queinnec/WWW/Meroon.html">
Meroon-V3</a>, <a href="http://kaolin.unice.fr/STk/"> STklos</a>). It
acknowledges the fact that all behaviors cannot be expressed at
class-definition time, that it should be possible to add new behaviors
to existing instances (data, particularly if persistent, often
pre-exist to treatments), that introspection is desirable and useful
for serialization, debug and all sorts of walkers, that some way to
customize or extend the implementation should also exist as well.
<p>
This document proposes an open model in the dynamic spirit of Scheme
(and Lisp). Meta-object aspects are not considered in this proposal
but are still possible.

<H1>Rationale</H1>

Objects are useful and trendy (at least before components
come). Meroon-V3 has proved useful for many years, has been ported to
(no particular order intended) mzscheme, scheme->C, elk, bigloo, scm,
guile, oscheme, mit-scheme, gambit. It is proposed to build on its
strengths.
<p>
This model makes possible that vectors be regular instances of the
object system since the object system allows fields to be regular (ie
Mono-Field (a Mono-Field only holds one value)) or indexed (ie
Poly-Field, the number of values it may hold is fixed at
instantiation-time). Vectors are regular objects
with a single indexed field.
<p> 
The proposed model is based on simple inheritance (for the same reasons
Java took).

<H1>Specification</H1>

The <a href="http://www-spi.lip6.fr/~queinnec/Reports/MeroonV3.ps.gz">
documentation of Meroon-V3</a> (23 pages) is available on the net.
The following interface stresses the features that are within the
scope of the present document.
<p>
The following are new special-forms. They use keywords ie symbols
prefixed with a colon. 
<pre>
(define-class class-name superclass-name
  (field-specification ...)
  ;; where field-specification is
  ;; ([ = | * ] field-name 
  ;;            [ :mutable | :immutable |
  ;;              :initialize (lambda () form) |      ; for (=) Mono-Field
  ;;              :initialize (lambda (index) form)   ; for (*) Poly-Field
  ;;             ] )
  [ :prototype ] )                                    ; non-instantiable class

(define-generic (generic-name variable ...)
  ;; where variable is
  ;;    symbol                                   ; regular variable
  ;;  | (symbol [ class-name ])                  ; discriminating variable
  [ default-body ] )

(define-method (generic-name variable ...)
  ;; where variable is
  ;;    symbol                     ; regular variable
  ;;  | (symbol class-name)        ; discriminating variable
  body                             ; (call-next-method) allowed
  )

(instantiate class-name 
  :mono-field-name form
  :poly-field-name form ...
  :poly-field-length size
  ... ) </pre>

<h2> Class definition </h2>
<p>
A <tt>define-class</tt> form creates a new class (redefinition of
classes is left unspecified). The first parameter is the name of the
class, the second is the name of the super-class, specifications of
fields appear as third parameter, additional parameters may appear
after.  Except initializers that are evaluated, no parameter or
expressions within parameters are evaluated.
<p>
A class is made of fields which may be regular or indexed. A
field may be mutable or not (mutable by default). A default
initializer may be specified (a thunk for a regular field, a unary
function for an indexed field). The form that define these
initializers are evaluated at class-definition time. The
<tt>:prototype</tt> class option forbids instantiation of the class.
<p>
When a class is defined, some functions are created: a predicate and
some read/write accessors. 

<h3> Example </h3>
<p>
The following class definition creates the
following functions: <tt>Foo?</tt>, <tt>Foo-bar</tt>,
<tt>Foo-hux</tt>, <tt>set-Foo-hux!</tt> and <tt>Foo-hux-length</tt>. A
variable <tt>Foo-class</tt> is also created that holds a (possibly
indirect) instance of <tt>Class</tt> for introspection purpose.
<pre>
(define-class Foo Object
  ((= bar :immutable)
   (* hux :initializer (lambda (i) i)) ) )
</pre>
<p>
Here is the signature of the generated functions: <pre>
(Foo? anySchemeValue) -> boolean
(Foo-bar aFooInstance) -> anySchemeValue
(Foo-hux aFooInstance aNaturalNumber) -> anySchemeValue
(set-Foo-hux! aFooInstance anySchemeValue aNaturalNumber) -> unspecified
(Foo-hux-length aFooInstance) -> aNaturalNumber
</pre>
<p> 
Predicates, such as <tt>Foo?</tt> may be invoked on any Scheme values.
Accessors may only apply on (possibly indirect) instances of <tt>Foo</tt>.
Writers return an unspecified value. Accessors whether readers or writers 
when applied on an indexed field take an index as last argument.


<h2> Generic definition </h2>
<p>
The <tt>define-generic</tt> form defines generic functions.  When a
generic function is defined, it does not possess any method. However
it may have a default body which is invoked when no specific method is
found (for instance, on values that are not objects). The generic
function must specify the discriminating variables (at least
one). Syntactically a discriminating variable appears within
parentheses.  If a class is associated to a discriminating variable,
it restricts the set of methods that may be adjoined to this generic
function (for instance, the following <tt>clone</tt> function may only
have methods defined on subclasses of <tt>Object</tt>). A generic
function may have more than one discriminating variable.
<p>
The following are predefined generic functions. New methods may be
added at will by programmers.
<pre>
(define-generic (initialize! (o Object)) ...)
(define-generic (clone (o Object)) ...)
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>initialize!</tt> function is automatically invoked on every
freshly created instance. It may be used to register the instance in
some data structures. 
<p>
The <tt>clone</tt> function, by default, performs a shallow copy of an
object.
<h3> Example </h3>
<p>
A generic predicate <tt>werk?</tt> may be defined on all (direct or
indirect) instances of <tt>Object</tt> as:
<pre>
(define-generic (werk? (o))
  #f )
</pre>

<h2> Method definition</h2>
<p>
The <tt>define-method</tt> form adjoins a method to a generic functions.
Methods may be adjoined to any generic functions provided that the
method has a compatible signature ie the same number of discriminating
variables at the same position associated to classes that are
sub-classes of the classes mentioned in the generic function
definition. If the generic function has a final dotted variable, then 
methods should also have such a final dotted variable.

<p>
Within the body of a method, it is possible to use the
<tt>(call-next-method)</tt> local special form. It is not possible to
use it elsewhere. The next method is defined to be the method that
would have been invoked if the current method was absent. It is
forbidden to define ambiguous multi-method that is a method that will
make some signature ambiguous. This problem may only arise on methods
that have strictly more than one discriminating variable: is SC is a
subclass of C and a method M1 is defined on SC * C then it is not
possible to define a method M2 on C * SC since that would make a call
on SC * SC ambiguous. However if a method M3 on SC * SC is defined and
does not contain a call to <tt>(call-next-method)</tt> then it is then
possible to define a method M2 on C * SC. [NOTE: that may be
considered as too dynamic, observe however that
<tt>call-next-method</tt> is not a variable.]

<h3> Example </h3>
<p>
If all (direct or indirect) instances of <tt>Foo</tt> satisfy the
<tt>werk?</tt> predicate, then one may write:
<pre>
(define-method (werk? (o Foo))
  #t ) 
</pre>

<h2> Instantiation </h2>
<p>
New objects may be created with the <tt>instantiate</tt> special form.
This form takes as first parameter the name of a class. The other
parameters specify the initial content of the object. The initial
content of a field is specified by a keyword whose name is the name of
the field to fill (prefixed with a colon). If the field is regular,
the keyword is followed by a single expression (to be evaluated); if
the field is indexed, the keyword is followed by as many expressions
(to be evaluated) as needed.  Alternatively, an indexed field may be
specified by its length in which case the initial content of this
indexed field is unspecified.
<p>
The fields do not need to be ordered nor to be all specified. In which
case, the initializer if defined at class-definition-time is run. For
a regular field, the initializer looks like a thunk; for an indexed
field, the initializer is a unary function taking the index as
argument. Fields are guaranteed to be filled in order starting from
inherited fields. Indexed fields are filled starting from 0. 

<h3> Example </h3>
<p>
Here are some instantiations of <tt>Foo</tt>:
<pre>
(instantiate Foo :bar 1 :hux 2 3 4)
(instantiate Foo :hux-length 3 :bar 11)
</pre>
Note that the values of the fields may be given in any order. A
mono-field defined with an initializer may be omitted. A poly-field
defined with an initializer only requires its length to be given. 

<h2> Primitives </h2>
<p>
The following are regular functions. Note: <tt>value</tt> means whatever
Scheme value; <tt>object</tt> means a (possibly indirect) instance of 
<tt>Object</tt>; <tt>class</tt> means a (possibly indirect) instance of 
<tt>Class</tt>.
<pre>
(object? value)                  ; anySchemeValue -> boolean
(object->class object)           ; Object -> Class
(is-a? value class)              ; anySchemeValue * Class -> boolean
(subclass? class super-class)    ; Class * Class -> boolean
</pre>
<p>
Among meta-objects only classes and fields are partially exposed not
by their definition but through some functions or some variables.
<tt>Class</tt> is the ``class of classes'' where classes are the
values returned by the <tt>object->class</tt> function. The document
does not impose <tt>Class</tt> to be definable by a specific
<tt>define-class</tt> form. Classes may only be used with the
functions whose name start with <tt>Class-</tt>. 
<p>
<tt>Field</tt> is the class of fields, objects reifying information
about fields. The document does not impose <tt>Field</tt> to be
definable by a specific <tt>define-class</tt> form. Fields may only be
used with the functions whose name start with <tt>Field-</tt>.
<p>
The definition of a class may be inspected via a number of functions.
It is possible to access the name of a class, its superclass
(<tt>#f</tt> if that does not exist) as well as its fields. Fields are
reified as if instances of a class of fields: <tt>Field</tt>. The
document does not impose <tt>Field</tt> to exist (as if explicitly
created by <tt>define-class</tt>) provided the <tt>Field-</tt>*
functions still exist.
<pre>
Object-class                     ; Class
(Class? value)                   ; anySchemeValue -> boolean
(Class-name class)               ; Class -> symbol
(Class-super-class class)        ; Class -> Class
(Class-field class index)        ; Class * nat -> Field
(Field? value)                   ; anySchemeValue -> boolean
(Field-name field)               ; Field -> symbol
(Field-mutable? field)           ; Field -> boolean
(Field-initializer field)        ; Field -> closure
(Mono-Field? value)              ; anySchemeValue -> boolean
(Poly-Field? value)              ; anySchemeValue -> boolean
(field-value object field [ index ])            ; Object * Field [* nat] -> value
(set-field-value! object value field [ index ]) ; Object * value * Field [* nat] -> unspecified
(field-length object field)                     ; Object * Field -> nat
</pre>
<p>
Two generic functions are predefined: 
<pre>
(initialize! object)             ; Object -> Object
(clone object)                   ; Object -> Object
</pre>


<H1>Implementation</H1>

<A HREF="http://www-spi.lip6.fr/~queinnec/Programs/MeroonV3-98Feb09.tar.gz">
Meroon-V3</a> implements the features of this document (and much more
than this in fact) but is currently 10k lines long. <A
HREF="http://www-spi.lip6.fr/~queinnec/Programs/meroonet93Mar19.tar.gz">
Meroonet</a> is another almost conforming essential implementation
(but for multi-methods) whose size makes it more readable (875 lines
including comments) described in chapter 11 of my book: Lisp in Small
Pieces, Cambridge U. Press, 1996.
