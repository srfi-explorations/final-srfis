<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
Syntax parameters are to the expansion process of a Scheme program
what parameters are to the evaluation process of a Scheme program. They allow
hygienic implementation of syntactic forms that would otherwise
introduce implicit identifiers unhygienically.
</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>
Syntax parameters are a mechanism for rebinding a macro definition
within the dynamic extent of a macro expansion. This provides a
convenient solution to one of the most common types of unhygienic
macro: those that introduce a unhygienic binding each time the macro
is used. Examples include a lambda form with a return keyword,
class macros that introduce a special self binding, or a while loop form
that provides an escape procedure as a binding for an auxiliary abort
keyword.
</p>

<p>
  With the syntax-rules macro system, it is not possible to introduce bindings
  unhygienically. With low-level macro systems like the sc-macro-transformer or the
  syntax-case macro system, one can break hygiene by constructing new identifiers
  in an existing syntactic closure. While use cases of introducing identifiers
  unhygienically like in SRFI 99 seem unproblematic, the use cases
  given above where bindings are based on identifiers that are
  completely independent of the arguments of the macro are often
  <a href="http://scheme2011.ucombinator.org/papers/Barzilay2011.pdf">severely
  broken</a>.
</p>

<p>
  With syntax parameters, instead of introducing the binding
  unhygienically each time, one instead creates one binding for the
  keyword, which is then adjusted later when the keyword to supposed
  to have a different meaning. As no new bindings are introduced, hygiene
  is preserved. This is similar to the dynamic binding mechanisms available
  at run-time (in the form of parameters), except that the dynamic
  binding only occurs during macro expansion. The code after macro
  expansion remains lexically scoped.
</p>

<h1>Examples</h1>

<p>
  The first example is certainly not an example of good functional
  programming style but it easily demonstrates how syntax parameters
  are used and why
  <code>call-with-current-continuation</code> is known as the
  fundamental control-flow construct.
</p>

<pre>
 (import (scheme base)
         (scheme write)  
         (srfi 139))
 
 (define-syntax-parameter abort
   (syntax-rules ()
     ((_ . _)
      (syntax-error "abort used outside of a loop"))))

 (define-syntax forever
   (syntax-rules ()
     ((forever body1 body2 ...)
      (call-with-current-continuation
       (lambda (escape) 
  	 (syntax-parameterize
	     ((abort
	      (syntax-rules ()
	        ((abort value (... ...))
	 	 (escape value (... ...))))))
	   (let loop ()
 	     body1 body2 ... (loop))))))))

 (define i 0)
 (forever
   (display i)
   (newline)
   (set! i (+ 1 i))
   (when (= i 10)
     (abort)))
</pre>

<p>
  The following example is derived from an example given in the Guile
  reference manual.
</p>

<pre>
 (import (scheme base)
         (scheme write)
         (srfi 1)
         (srfi 139))

 (define-syntax-parameter return
   (syntax-rules ()
     ((_ . _)
      (syntax-error "return used outside of a lambda^"))))

 (define-syntax lambda^
   (syntax-rules ()
     ((lambda^ formals body1 body2 ...)
      (lambda formals
        (call-with-current-continuation
         (lambda (escape)
          (syntax-parameterize
              ((return
                (syntax-rules ()
                  ((return value (... ...))
                   (escape value (... ...))))))
            body1 body2 ...)))))))

 (define product
   (lambda^ (list)
     (fold (lambda (n o)
             (if (zero? n)
                 (return 0)
                 (* n o)))
           1 list)))

<h1>Specification</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<pre>
 (define-syntax-parameter &lt;keyword&gt; &lt;transformer spec&gt;)
</pre>

<p>
Binds &lt;keyword&gt; to the transformer obtained by evaluating
&lt;transformer spec&gt;. The
transformer provides the default expansion for the syntax parameter,
and in the absence of syntax-parameterize, is functionally equivalent
to define-syntax. (For example, you may want to have the transformer
throw a syntax error indicating that the keyword is supposed to be
used in conjunction with another macro as in the examples above).
</p>

<pre>
 (syntax-parameterize
     ((&lt;keyword&gt; &lt;transformer spec&gt;) ...)
   &lt;body&gt;)
</pre>  

<p>
Adjusts the <code>&lt;keyword&gt;</code>s to use the transformer obtained
by evaluating the corresponding <code>&lt;transformer&gt;</code>s in
the expansion of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Each keyword must be bound to a
syntax parameter. <code>syntax-parameterize</code> differs from
<code>let-syntax</code> in that the binding is not shadowed, but
adjusted, and so uses of the keyword in the expansion
of <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> use the new transformers. This is
somewhat similar to how parameterize adjusts the values of regular
parameters, rather than creating new bindings.

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>
A sample implementation for an implementation of the R7RS is provided in form
of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/nieper/rapid-scheme">Rapid Scheme</a>
implementation, which implements this SRFI in the
<code>(rapid syntax-parameters)</code> library. This implementation will follow
any future changes in this specification.
</p>

<p>
Syntax parameters are also being implemented, at least, by Guile and Racket.
</p>

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

This SRFI wouldn't probably exist if Eli Barzilay, Ryan Culpepper, and
Matthew hadn't published their
paper <em><a href="http://scheme2011.ucombinator.org/papers/Barzilay2011.pdf">Keeping
it Clean with Syntax Parameters</a></em>, from which bits were
shamelessly reused for this SRFI.

Much of this specification is likewise derived from the Guile
Reference Manual and the Racket documentation.
