<H1>Abstract</H1>

SRFI-47 provides both uniform-typed and heterogeneous multidimensional
arrays which subsume Scheme vectors and strings.  The notation
presented here builds upon Common-Lisp array sytnax, incorporating
type abbreviations from SRFI-4, to represent heterogeneous and
uniform-typed arrays.
<P>

<H1>Issues</H1>

Common Lisp has a compact notation for rank 1 boolean arrays:
<CODE>#*</CODE> followed by a string of ones and zeros; <CODE>1</CODE>
for <CODE>#t</CODE>, <CODE>0</CODE> for <CODE>#f</CODE>
<P>
The first version allowed the <CODE>1</CODE> in the <CODE>#1A</CODE>
prefix to be elided.  That exception has been removed.

<H1>Rationale</H1>

<UL>
  <LI>
  Strings and vectors, which are rank-one arrays, have notations
  allowing them to be read and written by the procedures read and
  write.  Strings and vectors which are written, then read are EQUAL?
  to the originals.<P>

  <LI>
  A write-read invariant notation for other arrays would allow them to
  be easily saved and restored by programs.<P>

  <LI>
  A write-read invariant notation for arrays would allow them to be
  coded directly in programs.<P>

  <LI>
  The syntax for heterogeneous array constants,
  <CODE>#<VAR>n</VAR>A</CODE> followed by the list-decomposition of
  the array, is the same as the Common-Lisp array read-syntax.<P>

</UL>

<P>
SRFI-47, "Array", incorporates all the uniform vector types from
SFRI-4 "Homogeneous numeric vector datatypes", and adds complex types
composed of two 32-bit or two 64-bit floating-point numbers, and a
uniform boolean array type.  Multi-dimensional arrays subsume
homogeneous vectors as the one-dimensional case, obviating the need
for SRFI-4.
<P>
Implementations are required to accept all of the type denotations.
Those which the platform supports will have platform-dependent
representations; the others will be represented as the next larger
uniform-type implemented; defaulting to <CODE>vector</CODE> if there
are none.  All implementations must support the character array type,
the rank-1 character arrays being strings.
<P>
This arrangement has platforms supporting uniform array types using
them, with less capable platforms using vectors; both from the same
source code.
<P>

<H1>Specification</H1>

<H2>Syntax</H2>

A syntax for arrays is the <DFN>list-decomposition</DFN> of an array
with a prefix according to the type of the array.
<!-- The rank digit `<I>n</I>' is optional for rank 1 arrays. -->
The case of characters is not significant in the prefix characters.
<P>
Rank 1 character arrays which are not subarrays are
<CODE>write</CODE>n as Scheme strings; <CODE>display</CODE> treats
rank-1 character arrays which are not subarrays identically with
strings.
<P>
Rank 1 heterogeneous arrays which are not subarrays are
<CODE>write</CODE>n and <CODE>display</CODE>ed as Scheme vectors.

<P>
By <DFN>list-decomposition</DFN> is meant rank nestings of lists of
the elements where the most nested list has length equal to the last
dimension of the array and at top level has length equal to the first
dimension of the array.
<P>
A two-by-three array of unsigned 16-bit integers is written:
<PRE>
#2au16((0 1 2) (3 5 4))
</PRE>
This array could have been created by <CODE>(make-array (Au16) 2 3)</CODE>.
<PRE>
(array-dimensions #2au16((0 1 2) (3 5 4))) ==> (2 3)
</PRE>

<H1>Implementation</H1>

The following code from the

<A HREF="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~jaffer/SCM">SCM</A>
implementation ("Init5d9.scm") implements this array read-syntax.
<CODE>read:sharp</CODE> is called from <CODE>read</CODE> when a
<CODE>#\#</CODE> is read.  Its first argument is the character after
<CODE>#\#</CODE>; the second argument is the input port; the third
argument is the procedure to call for recursive reading.
<P>
<CODE>list-&gt;uniform-array</CODE> converts the list-decomposition
returned by <CODE>read</CODE> into the uniform array of the specified
type (or the next larger compatible type).
<P>
