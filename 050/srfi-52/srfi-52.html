<H1>Abstract</H1>

<p>This SRFI describes how to modify the <i>Revised Report</i> (<a
href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">R5RS</a>) in
order to enable conforming implementations to use an extended
character set such as (but not limited to) <a
href="http://www.unicode.org">Unicode</a>.


<p>Changes to some requirements of the report are recommended.
Currently, the <i>Revised Report</i> contains requirements which are
difficult or impossible to satisfy with some extended character sets.

<p>New required procedures are proposed, specified, and included
in the reference implementation.  These procedures enable portable
Scheme programs to manipulate Scheme source texts and source data
accurately, even in implementations using extended character sets.

<p>This SRFI concludes with some suggestions for implementors
interested in providing good Unicode support, using these suggestions
to illustrate how the proposed changes to the <i>Revised Report</i> can "play
out" in Unicode-based Scheme.

<p>This SRFI does <b>not</b> attempt to provide a comprehensive
library for global text processing.   For example, one issue in global
text processing is the need for linguistically-sensitive,
locale-sensitive procedures for sorting strings.   Such procedures are
beyond the scope of this SRFI.    On the other hand, by making Scheme
compatible with extended character sets, this SRFI is a step in the
direction of permitting global text processing standard libraries to
be developed in a form portable across all conforming implementations.

<p>This SRFI does <b>not</b> propose that implementations be required
to support Unicode or any other extended character set.  It does not
specify a representation for Unicode characters or strings.  It
<b>does</b> revise the specifications of the report so that
<code>char?</code> values <i>may be</i> Unicode (or other) characters.

<p>The reference implementation included should prove to be easily
ported to and effective for all ASCII-only implementations and for
many implementations using an 8-bit character set which is an
extension of ASCII (it will require very minor modifications for each
particular implementation).  Other implementations may need to use a
different implementation.



<H1>Issues</H1>

The reference implementation is currently untested.


<H1>Rationale</H1>

<p>The current edition of the <i>Revised Report</i> effectively defines a
<i>portable character set</i> for Scheme.  Portable programs should be
expressed using only these characters in their source text, character
constants, and string constants:

<pre>
        alphabetic letters:    a..z  A..Z

        digits:                0..9

        punctuation:           ( ) # ' ` , @ . " 
                               ; $ % & * / : + -
                               ^ _ ~ \ &lt; = &gt; ?

        whitespace:            newline space
</pre>

<p>In what follows, we will often be considering what happens if a
particular implementation permits additional characters.   Most
importantly, are we able to write <i>portable</i> Scheme programs that
behave reasonably even when running on an implementation that uses an
extended character set?


<H2>Problems With <code>char?</code>, <code>string?</code>, and
<code>symbol?</code></H2>

<p>The <i>Revised Report</i> imposes some structural requirements on
the <code>char?</code>, <code>string?</code>, and <code>symbol?</code>
types, relating these to the syntax of Scheme data representations.
For example, it contains requirements about case-mappings of alphabetic
characters.  The primary importance of the structural requirements in
the context of the report is that they enable portable, "metacircular"
Scheme programs.  For example, the structural requirements make it
possible to write a portable Scheme program which can accurately
implement a version of the procedure <code>read</code> which is able
to read data written using only the portable character set.

<p>There are problems with the structural requirements.

<p><b><i>The case-mapping problem:</i></b> The <i>Revised Report</i>'s
requirements for case mapping can not be satisfied for some extended
character sets.  For example, the requirements state that for a
<code>char-alphabetic?</code> character the procedure
<code>char-upcase</code> <i>must</i> return an uppercase character.
Yet for a character set containing the alphabetic character eszett (or
"lowercase sharp S"), that requirement can not necessarily be
satisfied in a pleasing way (if at all).

<p><b><i>The portable reader problem:</i></b> The existing character
class predicates such as <code>char-alphabetic?</code> are
insufficient for recognizing which extended characters may be part of
an identifier.

<p><b><i>The identifier equality and canonicalization problem:</i></b>
The case mapping and string comparison functions provided by the
<i>Revised Report</i> are insufficient for computing whether two
identifier names differ only by case distinctions.  They are not
suitable for converting an identifier name into the name of the symbol
that would yield if read by the native <code>read</code> procedure of
an implementation using an extended character set.

<p><b><i>The identifier concatenation problem:</i></b> The <i>Revised
Report</i> provides only <code>string-append</code> for deriving a new
identifier name by concatenating two more existing identifier names.
Unfortunately, <code>string-append</code> is an inappropriate
operation for concatenating identifiers which may use an extended
character set (as, for example, when sandhi rules apply).

<p><b><i>The character and string constant problem</i></b> The
<i>Revised Report</i> provides a syntax for character and string
constants however, it does not specify how that syntax should be
extended for larger character sets and does not provide sufficient
mechanism for a program to convert a character or string source form
to an internal representation if the source form contains or refers to
extended characters.

<p>Several of those problems (<i>portable reader</i>, <i>identifier
equality and canonicalization</i>, <i>identifier concatenation</i>,
and <i>string and character constants</i>) could be grouped into a
larger, more general category: <b><i>the metacircularity
problem</i></b>.  This SRFI is based in part on the presumption that
one should be able to write a portable Scheme program which can
accurately read and manipulate source texts in any implementation,
even if those source texts contain characters specific to that
implementation.


<H1>Specification</H1>

<p>The specification is divided into two parts.

<p>The first part, <b>Changes to the <i>Revised Report</i></b>,
describes how the report should be modified to permit extended
character sets.

<p>The second part, <b>New Procedures</b>, specifies the new
procedures defined by this report and included in the reference
implementation.  Because these procedures can not be implemented in a
way that is portable to all systems using extended character sets, and
because they are essential for solving the <b><i>metacircularity
problem</i></b>, the author recommends that these procedures be
included in future editions of the <i>Revised Report</i> as required
procedures.



<H2>Changes to the <i>Revised Report</i></H2>

<H3>Chapter 2, Introduction:</H3>

<p>Rather than:

<blockquote>Upper and lower case forms of a letter are never distinguished
except within character and string constants. For example, Foo is the
same identifier as FOO, and #x1AB is the same number as
#X1ab.</blockquote>

say:

<blockquote>Case distinctions are not significant except within
character and string constants. For example, Foo is the same
identifier as FOO, and #x1AB is the same number as #X1ab.</blockquote>

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> The corrected text is consistent with what was
apparently intended however it is more appropriate for extended
character sets because in some systems using extended character sets,
ignoring distinctions between upper and lower forms of the letters in
a string is not the same thing as ignoring case distinctions in the
string.</i>


<H3>Section 6.3.3, Symbols:</H3> 

<p>The specification of <code>symbol->string</code> says:

<blockquote>Returns the name of <i>symbol</i> as a string. If the
symbol was part of an object returned as the value of a literal
expression (section 4.1.2) or by a call to the <code>read</code>
procedure, and its name contains alphabetic characters, then the
string returned will contain characters in the implementation's
preferred standard case -- some implementations will prefer upper
case, others lower case. If the symbol was returned by
<code>string->symbol</code>, the case of characters in the string
returned will be the same as the case in the string that was passed to
<code>string->symbol</code>. It is an error to apply mutation
procedures like <code>string-set!</code> to strings returned by this
procedure.</blockquote>

<p>It should say:

<blockquote>Returns the name of <i>symbol</i> as a string. If the
symbol was part of an object returned as the value of a literal
expression (section 4.1.2) or by a call to the <code>read</code>
procedure, its name will be in the implementation's preferred standard
case -- some implementations will prefer upper case, others lower
case. If the symbol was returned by <code>string->symbol</code>, the
string returned will be <code>string=?</code> to the string that was
passed to <code>string->symbol</code>. It is an error to apply
mutation procedures like <code>string-set!</code> to strings returned
by this procedure.</blockquote>

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> (see previous).</i>

<H3>Section 6.3.4, Characters:</H3> 

<h4>character constant syntax</h4>

<p>The specification of character syntax says:

<blockquote>
<i>[...]</i> If <code>&lt;character&gt;</code> in
<code>#\&lt;character&gt;</code> is alphabetic, then the character
following &lt;character&gt; must be a delimiter character such as a
space or parenthesis.
</blockquote>

It should say: 

<blockquote>
<i>[...]</i> If <code>&lt;character&gt;</code> in
<code>#\&lt;character&gt;</code> is not one of the characters:

<pre>
        digits:                0..9

        punctuation:           ( ) # ' ` , @ . " 
                               ; $ % & * / : + -
                               ^ _ ~ \ &lt; = &gt; ?

        whitespace:            newline space
</pre>

then the character following &lt;character&gt; must be a delimiter
character such as a space or parenthesis.
</blockquote>

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> For the portable character set, this change to
the <i>Revised Report</i> makes no difference -- the meaning is the
same.  However, this change makes it possible for a character name to
consist of more than one ideographic (hence non-alphabetic) character
without creating an ambiguous syntax.</i>


<h4>character order</h4>

<p>The specification of <code>char&lt;?</code> and related procedures 
says:

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The upper case characters are in order. For example, <code>(char&lt;? #\A #\B)</code> returns <code>#t</code>. 
<li> The lower case characters are in order. For example, <code>(char&lt;? #\a #\b)</code> returns <code>#t</code>. 
<li> The digits are in order. For example, <code>(char&lt;? #\0 #\9)</code> returns <code>#t</code>. 
<li> Either all the digits precede all the upper case letters, or vice versa. 
<li> Either all the digits precede all the lower case letters, or vice versa. 
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It should say:

<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>The upper case characters <code>A..Z</code> are in order. For
    example, <code>(char&lt;? #\A #\B)</code> returns <code>#t</code>.
    However, implementations may provide additional upper case letters
    which are not in order.

<li>The lower case characters <code>a..z</code> are in order. For
    example, <code>(char&lt;? #\a #\b)</code> returns
    <code>#t</code>. However, implementations may provide additional
    lower case letters which are not in order.

<li>The digits <code>0..9</code> are in order. For example,
    <code>(char&lt;? #\0 #\9)</code> returns <code>#t</code>.
    However, implementations may provide additional digits which are
    not in order.

<li>Either all the digits <code>0..9</code> precede the upper case
    letters <code>A..Z</code>, or vice versa.

<li>Either all the digits <code>0..9</code> precede the lower case
    letters <code>a..z</code>, or vice versa.

</ul>
</blockquote>


<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> The changes permit implementations to use the
"natural" ordering of an extended character set so long as that order
is consistent with the order required for the small set portable
characters.  For example, a Unicode implementation might order
characters by their assigned codepoint values -- but that would result
in (extended character set) upper case letters that follow
<code>a..z</code> while <code>A..Z</code> precede
<code>a..z</code>.</i>


<h4>character classes</h4>

<p>With regard to character class predicates such as
<code>char-alphabetic?</code> the <i>Revised Report</i> says:

<blockquote>
These procedures return <code>#t</code> if their arguments are
alphabetic, numeric, whitespace, upper case, or lower case characters,
respectively, otherwise they return <code>#f</code>.  The following
remarks, which are specific to the ASCII character set, are intended
only as a guide: The alphabetic characters are the 52 upper and lower
case letters. The numeric characters are the ten decimal digits. The
whitespace characters are space, tab, line feed, form feed, and
carriage return.
</blockquote>

It should instead say:

<blockquote>
These procedures return <code>#t</code> if their arguments are
alphabetic, numeric, whitespace, upper case, or lower case characters,
respectively, otherwise they return <code>#f</code>.  The characters
<code>a..z</code> and <code>A..Z</code> must be alphabetic.  The
digits <code>0..9</code> must be numeric.  Space and newline must be
whitespace.

<p>The procedure <code>read</code>, the syntax accepted by a
particular implementation, and the procedure
<code>char-whitespace?</code> must all agree about whitespace
characters.  For example, if a character causes
<code>char-whitespace?</code> to return <code>#t</code>, then that
character must serve as a delimiter.
</blockquote>

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> Most of the guidance formerly provided
regarding ASCII should really apply to the portable character set.
This enables portable Scheme programs to use these procedures in a
parser for Scheme data that consists only of portable characters.
The new requirement for <code>char-whitespace?</code> allows a
portable Scheme program to recognize the same set of whitespace
delimiters as its host implementation.</i>

<h4>character case-mapping</h4>

<p>With regard to case-mapping, the specification of
<code>char-upcase</code> and <code>char-upcase</code> says:

<blockquote>
These procedures return a character <code>char<sub>2</sub></code> such
that <code>(char-ci=? char char<sub>2</sub>)</code>. In addition, if
<code>char</code> is alphabetic, then the result of
<code>char-upcase</code> is upper case and the result of
<code>char-downcase</code> is lower case.
</blockquote>

<p>It should say

<blockquote>

These procedures return a character <code>char<sub>2</sub></code> such
that <code>(char-ci=? char char<sub>2</sub>)</code>. In addition, 
<code>char-upcase</code> must map <code>a..z</code> to
<code>A..Z</code> and <code>char-downcase</code> must map
<code>A..Z</code> to <code>a..z</code>.
</blockquote>

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> In some extended character sets, not all
lowercase alphabetic characters have a corresponding uppercase
character and not all uppercase alphabetic characters have a
corresponding lowercase letter.   This change recognizes that while
preserving the required behavior of these procedures for the portable
character set.</i>


<H3>Section 6.3.5, Strings:</H3> 

The introduction to strings says:

<blockquote>
Some of the procedures that operate on strings ignore the difference
between upper and lower case. The versions that ignore case have
``-ci'' (for ``case insensitive'') embedded in their names.
</blockquote>

<p>It should say:

<blockquote>
Some of the procedures that operate on strings ignore the difference
between strings in which upper and lower case variants of the same
character occur in corresponding positions. The versions that ignore case
have ``-ci'' (for ``case insensitive'') embedded in their names.
</blockquote>

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> The string ordering predicates, in general,
are based on a lexical ordering induced by the constituent characters
and their order of appearance within the strings.  At the same time,
"case insensitive string comparison" has a different meaning
linguistically -- a character-based lexical ordering is not
appropriate.  This change simply makes it clear that the simple
character-wise lexical ordering is the one intended.   For example,
this change emphasizes that <code>string-ci=?</code> may be portably
and correctly implemented in terms of <code>char-ci=?</code>.
</i>



<H2>New Procedures</H2>

<p>This SRFI proposes the addition of a new section to the <i>Revised
Report</i>, <b>6.6.5 Parsing Scheme Data</b>, requiring
the functions specified below.

<p><u>procedure:</u><code>(string->character <i>string</i>)</code>
<blockquote>
If the string formed by <code>(string-append "#\\"
<i>string</i>)</code>, if suitably delimited, would be read by
<code>read</code> as a character constant, then return the character
it denotes.  Otherwise, return <code>#f</code>.
</blockquote>

<p><u>procedure:</u><code>(string->string <i>string</i>)</code>
<blockquote> If the string formed by <code>(string-append "\""
<i>string</i> "\"")</code> would be read by <code>read</code> as a
string constant, then return a string which is <code>string=?</code>
to the string it denotes.  Otherwise, return <code>#f</code>.
</blockquote>

<p><u>procedure:</u><code>(string->symbol-name <i>string</i>)</code>
<blockquote> If <code><i>string</i></code> would, if suitably
delimited, be read by <code>read</code> as an identifier, then return
a string which is <code>string=?</code> to what would be returned by
<code>symbol->string</code> for that symbol.  Otherwise, return
<code>#f</code>.
</blockquote>

<p><u>procedure:</u><code>(form-identifier <i>string<sub>1</sub></i> ...)</code>
<blockquote> The arguments must be <i>valid identifiers</i> (see
below).

<p>This procedure should return a valid identifier (conceptually)
formed by concatenating the arguments, then making any adjustments
necessary to form a valid identifier.

<p><code>form-identifier</code> must preserve the following invariant
for all arguments for which it is defined:

<pre>
    (string=? (apply form-identifier (map string->symbol-name <i>s<sub>1</sub></i> ...))
              (string->symbol-name (form-identifier <i>s<sub>1</sub></i> ...)))
    => #t
</pre>

<p>A <i>valid identifier</i> for these purposes is any string for
which <code>string->symbol-name</code> would not return false.
</blockquote>


<p><u>procedure:</u><code>(char-delimiter? <i>char</i>)</code>
<blockquote> Return <code>#t</code> if <code>read</code> would treat
<code><i>char</i></code> as a delimiter, <code>#f</code> otherwise.
</blockquote>

<p><i><b>New Procedures Rationale:</b> These procedures enable
programs to parse Scheme data that may use an extended
character set. Absent these or equivalent procedures, portable
programs can only parse Scheme data written only using the portable
character set.</i>


<H1>Illustrating a Unicode-based Scheme</H1>

<p>Let us suppose that one wanted to make a Scheme implementation with
two properties:

<p><b>Standard Scheme:</b>  The implementation should meet the
requirements of the latest edition of the <i>Revised Report</i>.

<p><b>Global Scheme:</b> The implementation should allow users to
write character constants, string constants, and identifier names in
their native language.   For example, German speaking users should be
free to use eszett in their identifier names and Chinese speaking
users should be free to use identifier names composed of ideographs.

<p>How might we do accomplish this?   Let's assume that the changes to
the <i>Revised Report</i> recommended above have been made.  This
sketch isn't the <i>only</i> way to do it --- just a reasonable way.

<p><b>Characters as Unicode codepoints</b> One natural approach to
take is to make each Unicode codepoint representable as a Scheme
<code>char?</code> value.  Absent the changes to the <i>Revised
Report</i> we could not easily do this -- for example, <i>R5RS</i>
requirements for the character ordering and case-mapping procedures
would be difficult to satisfy.  With the proposed changes, there is no
problem.

<p><b>Unicode <i>Best Practices</i> for Identifier Equivalence</b> Some of
the author's of the Unicode standard and related technical reports
have thought very hard about how decide <i>identifier equivalence</i>
in programming languages which ignore distinctions of case but allow
people to write identifier names in their native languages.  (For
example, see <a
href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Programming_Language_Identifiers">
Annex 7 ("Programming Language Identifiers") of Unicode Technical
Report 15 ("Unicode Normalization Forms")</a>.

<p>We can adopt those best practices for our Scheme fairly directly.
Most especially, the new procedure <code>string->string</code> reifies
our concept of identifier equality in a form that will allow portable
Scheme programs to access the identifier equality relation used by our
implementation.

<p><b>Character Constants and String Constants</b>  We can choose
whatever syntax we like for our extended character set Scheme, just so
long as it is consistent with the requirements for delimiters.
Portable programs can use procedures such as <code>string->char</code>
to access our extended namespace of characters.



<H1>Implementation</H1>

The enclosed implementation is suitable for a hypothetical Scheme
which supports <i>only</i> the portable character set.  The odds are
good that it will run correctly with only very minor modifications on
most other implementations.

<p>Ambitious implementations using extended character sets may need to
use a different implementation entirely.
