<H1>Abstract</H1>
<p>
This specifies a reader extension for extended string quasi-literals,
including nicer multi-line strings, and enclosed unquoted expressions.
<p>
This proposal is related to 
<a href="../srfi-108/srfi-108.html">SRFI-108 (extended string quasi-literals)</a> and <a href="../srfi-107/srfi-107.html">SRFI-107 (XML reader syntax)</a>,
as they share quite a bit of syntax.

<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>This proposal aims to aid in a number of related problems
relating to string literals.

<h2>Multi-line string literals</h2>
<p>Standard Scheme literals are awkward for multi-line strings.
One problem is that the same delimiter (double-quote) is used for both
the start and end of the string.  This is error-prone and not robust:
adding or removing a single character changes the meaning of the entire
rest of the program.
A related problem is that if the delimiter appears in the string it
needs to be quoted using an escape character, which can get hard-to-read.
If we have distinct start and end delimiters, then we only
need to escape <q>unbalanced</q> use of the delimiters.
<p>
A common solution is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document"><q>here document</q></a>,
where distinct multi-character start and end delimiters are used.
For example the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell">Unix shell</a>
uses uses <code>&lt;&lt;</code> followed by an arbitrary token
as the start delimiter, and then the same token as the end delimiter:
<pre>
tr a-z A-Z &lt;&lt;END_TEXT
one two three
uno dos tres
END_TEXT
</pre>
<p>
This proposal uses just <code>#&amp;{</code> and <code>}</code>
as the default start and end delimiters, respectively:
<pre>
(string-upcase &amp;{
one two three
uno dos tres
})
</pre>
<h2>Enclosed (unquoted) expressions</h2>

<p>Commonly one wants to construct a string as a concatenation of
literal text and evaluated expressions.
Using explicit string concatenation (Scheme <code>string-append</code>
or Java's <code>+</code> operator)
is verbose and can be error-prone.
Using <code>format</code> is an alternative, but it is also a bit verbose.
Worse, the format specifier and expression it controls
are non-adjacent, which is awkward and error-prone.
Nicer is to be able to use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_interpolation">Variable interpolation</a>, as in Unix shells:
<pre>
echo "Hello ${name}!"
</pre>
<p>
This proposal uses the syntax:
<pre>
&amp;{Hello &amp;[name]!}
</pre>

<p>
Note that <span><code class="literal">&amp;</code></span> is used both
as part of the prefix <code class="literal">&amp;{</code> to mark the entire string, and as an escape character within the string.
See the discussion
<a href="../srfi-108/srfi-108.html#delimiter-options">SRFI-108 (delimiter options)</a>.

<h2>Template processing</h2>

Going one step further, a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor">template processor</a>
has many uses.
Examples include <a href="http://brl.sourceforge.net/">BRL</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages">JSP</a>,
which are both used to generate web pages.
<p>
The simple solution is to allow general Scheme expressions in substitutions:
<pre>
&amp;{Hello &amp;[(string-capitalize name)]!}
</pre>
<p>
You can also leave out the square brackets when the expression is
a parenthesized expression:
<pre>
&amp;{Hello &amp;(string-capitalize name)!}
</pre>
<p>
Note that this syntax for unquoted expressions matches that used in
<a href="../srfi-107/srfi-107.html">SRFI-107 (XML reader syntax)</a>.

<h2>Indentation and line-endings</h2>
<p>By default there is a one-to-one mapping between
whitespace in the literal and the resulting string
(except that <var>line-ending</var> is normalized to the newline character),
but it is often convenient (or at least prettier)
for them to be different.
<p>
You can of course easily add extra newline characters beyond those in
the literal:
<pre>
&amp{a&newline;b} &#x027F9 "a\nb"
</pre>
<p>
Conversely, the <dfn>line-continuation marker</dfn>
<code class="literal">&amp;-</code> is used to suppress a newline:
<pre>
&amp;{abc&amp;-
  def} &#x027F9 "abc  def"
</pre>
<p>The marker also suppresses any <i>intraline whitespace</i> between
the <code class="literal">&amp;-</code> and the newline,
but it does <em>not</em> suppress <i>intraline whitespace</i>
following the newline.
In the latter respect it differs from the <code class="literal">\</code>
at the end of a line in an R6RS string literal.
<p>
Suppressing initial whitespace is more generally useful than
just for continuation lines.  For example it is important for properly
indenting source code to match the program structure.
The <dfn>indentation marker</dfn> <code class="literal">&amp;|</code>
is used to mark the end of insignificant initial whitespace,
typically to indent strings inside a function.
The <code class="literal">&amp;|</code> characters and all the preceding
whitespace are removed:
<pre>
(display (string-upcase &amp;{
     &amp;|one two three
     &amp;|uno dos tres
}) out)
</pre>
<p>
As a matter of style, all of the indentation lines should line up:
An implementation may warn if indentation is inconsistent.
It is an error if there are any non-whitespace characters
between the previous newline and the indentation marker.
It is also an error to write an indentation marker
before the first newline in the literal.
<p>
One does not normally want an initial newline in a multi-line string.
However, as in the above example, the natural way to write this
is with the left brace on the previous line - otherwise either
the source is <q>wrongly</q> indented, or the matching columns
in the result don't line up in the source.
For that reason <code class="literal">&amp;|</code>
also suppresses an initial newline.
Specifically, when the initial left-brace is followed by
optional (invisible) intraline-whitespace, then a newline,
then optional intraline-whitespace (the indentation), and
finally the indentation marker <code class="literal">&amp;|</code>
- all of which is removed from the output.
Otherwise the <code class="literal">&amp;|</code> only removes
initial intraline-whitespace on the same line (and itself).
<p>
However, traditionally there should be a <em>final</em> newline
in a multi-line string.  So the following styles are suggested.
If the text is at top-level, or more generally,
the closing brace is in the first column, then write it like this:
<pre>
(define help-message &amp;{
   &amp;|This is the first of 2 lines.
   &amp;|This last line is followed by a final newline.
})
</pre>
When the text is nested such that writing the closing brace should not
be in the left column, then you can use an extra indentation marker,
like this:
<pre>
(display
  (string-upcase &amp;{
     &amp;|This is the first of 2 lines.
     &amp;|This last line is followed by a final newline.
     &amp;|})
  out)
</pre>
<p>Note in the above there are 3 indentation markers, but the
resulting string has 2 lines followed by a total of 2 newline characters,
because the first indentation markers suppresses the initial newline.
<p>
If you do not want to not end the final line with a newline,
you can either use a line-continuation marker,
or end the line with the closing brace:
<pre>
(display (string-upcase &amp;{
   &amp;|This is the first of 2 lines.
   &amp;|This last line is not followed by a final newline.}) out)
</pre>
<!--
<p>An idea - perhaps not sufficiently useful - allows prefixed line numbers.
<pre>
(display (string-upcase &amp;|{
     1: |one two three
     2: |uno dos tres
  }) out)
</pre>
-->
<!--
FIXME - see later ...
It might be useful to allow comments at the end of each line.
For example, this facility could be used for line numbers:
<pre>
(display (string-upcase &amp;{
     &amp;|one two three &amp;;; 1
     &amp;|uno dos tres &amp;;;  2
  }) out)
</pre>
<p>
Here <span><code>&amp;;</code></span> can be followed by horizontal whitespace
or comments; both the <span><code>&amp;;</code></span> and the whitespace and comments
are ignored.  (It is an error if there is anything else following.)
This is useful to add per-line comments.  It is also useful to indicate
that the line ends with whitespace; adding <span><code>&amp;;</code></span> after the
included whitespace makes that clear.
-->

<h2>Embedded comments</h2>
<p>For long strings it may be useful to embed comments, even
though this is redundant since it could be done using enclosed expressions:
<pre>
&{preamble &amp;[#|ignore this part|#] postamble}
</pre>
<p>
However, this seems clumsy, so this specification has a comment syntax:
<pre>
&amp;{preamble &amp;#|ignore this part|# postamble}
</pre>
For example for line numbers:
<pre>
(display (string-upcase &amp;{
     &amp;|&amp;#|line 1|#one two
     &amp;|&amp;#|line 2|# three
     &amp;|&amp;#|line 3|#uno dos tres
  }) out)
</pre>
<p>

(It is temping to allow comments before a
<code class="literal">&amp;|</code> indentation marker,
but it entails more complexity that seems justified.)

<h2>Character escapes</h2>
<p>
We support the standard XML syntax for character references,
using either decimal or hexadecimal values.
The following string has two instances of the Ascii escape character,
as either decimal 27 or hex <code>1B</code>:
<pre>
&amp;{&amp;#27;&amp;#x1B;}
</pre>
<!--<p><b>Design note:</b> Note we use <code>#&</code>
to introduce a literal, and <code>#</code> for a character escape. This could
be confusing, but we assume numeric character escapes will be rare.-->
<p>
You can also use the pre-defined XML entity names:
<pre>
&amp;{&amp;amp; &amp;lt; &amp;gt; &amp;quot; &amp;apos;} &#x027F9 "&amp; &lt; &gt; \&quot; &apos;"
</pre>
<p>
In addition, <code>&amp;lbrace;</code> <code>&amp;rbrace;</code>
can be used for left and right curly brace:
<pre>
&amp;{&amp;rbrace;_&amp;lbrace;}  &#x027F9 "}_{"
</pre>
Note that these are only needed for unbalanced braces:
<pre>
&amp{A left brace '{' followed by a right brace '}' is ok.}
  &#x027F9 "A left brace '{' followed by a right brace '}' is ok."
</pre>
<p>
An implementation <em>must</em> support the character names <code>amp</code>,
<code>lt</code>, <code>gt</code>, <code>quot</code>,
<code>apos</code>, <code>lbrace</code>, and <code>rbrace</code>.
An implementation <em>should</em> support
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007/w3centities-f.ent">the standard XML entity names</a>
(though resource-limited or non-Unicode-based implementations
are not required to).  For example:
<pre>
&amp;{L&amp;aelig;rdals&amp;oslash;yri}
  &#x027F9 "L&#xe6;rdals&#xf8;yri"
</pre>
An implementation <em>should</em> also support the standard
R7RS character names <code>null</code>, <code>alarm</code>,
<code>backspace</code>, <code>tab</code>, <code>newline</code>,
<code>return</code>, <code>escape</code>, <code>space</code>,
and <code>delete</code>.  For example:
<pre>
&amp;{&amp;escape;&amp;space;}
</pre>
<p>
The reader translates the entity reference
<code>&amp;<var>name</var>;</code>
to the variable reference <code>$entity$:<var>name</var></code>.
Therefore user-defined entity names are possible:
<pre>
(define $entity$:crnl "\r\n")
&amp;{&amp;crnl;} &#x027F9 "\r\n"
</pre>
<p>
<!--
<p><b>Discussion:</b> Instead of
<code>&amp;lcurly; &amp;rcurly; &amp;lsquare; &amp;rsquare;</code>
would other names be better?  For example:
<code>&amp;lbrace; &amp;rbrace; &amp;lbracket; &amp;rbracket;</code>.
If we support slash-forms perhaps we don't need them,
but instead one could write:
<code>&amp;\{ &amp;\} &amp;\[ &amp;\]</code>.
-->

<h2>Possible extensions</h2>
<p>
This section discusses some ideas that seem worthwhile,
but need more thought, so are deferred for now.

<h3>Special characters</h3>
<p>
Only the characters <code>'{'</code>, <code>'}'</code>, and
<code>'&amp;'</code> are reserved and thus need special escaping.
Braces only need escaping when unbalanced, which is likely
to be rare in both text and quoted programs, thus the only
real problem is <code class="literal">&amp;</code>.
A common solution in other languages is doubling.
That is one could read <code>&amp;&amp;</code> as
a single <code>&amp;</code>.  However, doubling is not otherwise
used in Scheme, so it may not be worth adding as a special case.
<p>
It might convenient to support standard string single-character slash
escapes in some form,  For example:
<pre>
&amp;{Hello!&amp;\r&amp;\n} &#x027F9 "Hello\r\n"
</pre>
<p>
Maybe not really needed, since one could just write:
<pre>
&amp;{Hello&amp["\r\n"]}
</pre>

<h3>Formatting</h3>
<p>
Many Scheme implementations use <a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-48/srfi-48.html"><code>format</code></a> for
finer-grained control of the output.  A problem with <code>format</code>
is that the association between format specifiers and data expressions
is positional, which is hard-to-read and error-prone.
A better solution places the specifier adjacant to the data expression:
<pre>
&amp;{The response was &amp;~,2f(* 100.0 (/ responses total))%.}
</pre>
<p>
The reader would map this to:
<pre>
($string$ "The response was " ($format$ "~,2f" (* 100.0 (/ responses total))) "%.")
</pre>
<p>A simple definition of <code>$format$</code>:
<pre>
(define ($format$ fmt . args) (apply format #t fmt args))
</pre>
<p>Implementations that support
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string"><code>printf</code>-style formatting</a> can also optionally support those:
<pre>
&amp;{The response was &amp;%.2f(* 100.0 (/ responses total))%.}
</pre>
This would be read as:
<pre>
($string$ "The response was " ($sprintf$ "%.2f" (* 100.0 (/ responses total))) "%.")
</pre>
<p>
(The JavaFX Script language provided similar functionality.)

<h3>Internationalized strings</h3>
<p>
Internationalization refers to a framework so that
text messages can be emitted in multiple (human) languages,
depending on the user's preferred locale.
See <a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-29/srfi-29.html">SRFI-29</a>.
Strings that may need to be translated are marked specially.
For the sake of discussion we can use the prefix <code>^</code>
followed by a <var>key</var>:
<pre>
&amp;^hello{Hello!}
</pre>
Here the key is the string <code>hello</code>.  At runtime this key
is combined with the <q>current language</q> to produce a translated string.
If no translation is found, then the string in the literal <code>Hello!</code>
is used.
<p>
If there is no explicit key, the string is used as the key.
In the following, <code>"Hello!"</code> is used as the key.
<pre>
&amp;^{Hello!}
</pre>

<h3>Complex formats and internationalization</h3>
<p>
A simple implementation of <code>$format$</code> as
a call to the <code>format</code> function
does not handle format specifiers that change the
argument order.
These are primarily useful for localizing messages,
since one might want change argument order when translating
from one language to another.  Consider this warning message:
<pre>
&amp^{['&amp;[partition]' has only &amp;[avail] bytes free.}
</pre>
<p>
A translation might want to re-order the arguments, as if it were:
<pre>
&amp^{Only &amp;[avail] bytes free on '&amp;[partition]'.}
</pre>
<p>
That could be done if the translation database provides
for a format that re-orders the arguments,
perhaps using the tilde-asterisk format specifier forms.
For example (to pick some hypothetical translation database syntax):
<pre>
"'&amp;[]' has only &amp;[] bytes free." => "Only &amp;~1@*~d[] bytes free on '&amp;~0@*~s[]'."
</pre>
<p>
It follows that we can't use a one-to-one translation from
a format-specifier (<code>$format$</code>) to a call to the
<code>format</code> function.  Instead we need to work with
single format string constructed from the entire text to be localized.
The complicates the implementation.
The basic algorithm should be something like:
<ol>
<li>
Construct a <var>text-part</var> by taking the literal text,
format specifiers, and expanded entity-references.
Leave out all the enclosed expressions.
Exact translation format to be specified,
but one idea is to represent each enclosed expression
by <code class="literal">&amp;[]</code> if there is no format-specifier,
and <code class="literal">&amp;[<var>specifier</var>]</code> if there is one.
<li>
If translation is specified, create a <var>translation-key</var>:
Either use an explicit <var>translation-key</var> given in the quasi-literal, or use
the <var>text-part</var> as an implicit <var>translation-key</var>
(GNU <code>gettext</code>-style).
Look for a translation in the translation database.
If one is found, use that as the translated <var>text-part</var>;
otherwise use <var>text-part</var> as-is.
<li>Convert the <var>text-part</var> to a format-string
by escaping stand-alone <code class="literal">~</code> characters.
Replace each <code class="literal">&amp;[]</code>
by <code class="literal">~a</code>,
and each <code class="literal">&amp;[<var>specifier</var>]</code>
by the <code class="literal"><var>specifier</var></code>,
<li>Invoke <code>format</code> with the resulting format string and
the enclosed expressions as the arguments.
</ol>
<!--
<p>
This procedure can be optimized at compile time if there is
no localizarion or format specifiers.  Unfortunately, if
translation is required, then we basically have to convert
the <code>$quasi-string$</code> back to a <var>text-part</var> string,
translate it, and then parse the translated string.
Only the first part can be done at compile-time.
This unparsing and reparsing is hard to avoid
as long as the translation mappings are in text form, and anything
else seems difficult to work with.
-->
<!--
<p>
Hence the actual translation is more complex:
<pre>
<code class="literal">(format #t (string-concat</code> <b>TrToFormat[</b><var class="non-terminal">form</var><b>]</b>...<code class="literal">)</code> <b>TrToFormatArgs[</b><var class="non-terminal">form</var><b>]</b>...<code class="literal">)</code>
</pre>
where:
<pre>
<b>TrToFormat[</b>"<var>string-literal</var>"<b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; "<var>string-literal</var>" <i>except with % doubled</i>
<b>TrToFormatArgs[</b>"string-literal"<b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; #|nothing|#
<b>TrToFormat[</b>($entity-reference$ name)<b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; mapped-named
<b>TrToFormatArgs[</b>($entity-reference$ name)<b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; #|nothing|#
<b>TrToFormat[</b>($format$ <var class="non-terminal">format</var> <var class="non-terminal">expression</var> ...)<b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; <code>"</code><var class="non-terminal">format</var><code>"</code>
<b>TrToFormatArgs[</b>($format$ format <var class="non-terminal">expression</var> ...)<b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; <var class="non-terminal">expression</var> ...
<b>TrToFormat[</b>other-form<b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; %a
<b>TrToFormatArgs[</b>other-form<b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; other-form
</pre>
Note that the $entity-reference$ invocation after resolving to
a string becomes part of the format, so it must be
resolveable at compile-time.  ((Or call string-concat to build format string.))

<pre>
($format$ format expression ...)
</pre>
When standalone, this is implemented as:
<pre>
(format #t format expression ...)
</pre>
-->

<h3>User-defined end token</h3>
<p>
Many languages, including the Bourne shell,
allow for a a user-defined end token.
We could allow the as an option following a marker
character - for example <code class="literal">!</code>:
</p>
<pre>
(string-upcase &amp;!END-TEXT{
one two three
uno dos tres
}!END-TEXT)
</pre>

<!--
<h2>Translation to S-expressions</h2>
<p>
This specification could leave it implementation-defined how
the above syntax is implemented.  Instead, following Scheme
tradition (including old-fashioned quasi-quotation), we specify
a mapping performed by the Scheme reader into a simpler S-expression format.
This allows quotation to be well-defined, and makes it easier
for various tools (and macros) to process this syntax.
For example:
<pre>
&amp;{Hello &[name]!}
</pre>
is read as if it were:
<pre>
($string$ "Hello " $&lt;&lt;$ name $>>$ "!")
</pre>
We assume a predefined macro named <code>$string$</code>
which concatenates the various pieces together.  The dollar-signs
are used to reduce name conflicts - they indicate <code>$string$</code>
is a special keyword which would normally not be redefined by the user.
<p>
Delimiting an enclosed expression inside a <code>$&lt;&lt;$</code>...<code>$>>$</code> pair
is mostly redundant, but can be important if we add support for
format specifiers: Enclosed expressions should be formatted
as if with a <code>~a</code> format specifiers, while literal
text should be part of the format string.  The distinction
matters if we support format specifiers that re-order the arguments
(move the argument cursors), which is useful for internationalization.

<p>
If we allowed <var class="non-terminal">tagname</var> to be an
arbitrary Scheme identifier there would be parsing difficulties.
One problem is that we use <code class="literal">&amp;|</code> to skip
indentation, but R7RS identifier syntax uses <code class="literal">|</code>
as a delimiter for symbols with special characters.
Another conflict is if an implementation uses
<code class="literal">&amp;~</code> or
<code class="literal">&amp;%</code> to indicate format specifiers,
since these are allowed as R7RS identifier <var>initial</var> characters.
<p>
An implementation <em>may</em> extend
<var class="non-terminal">tagname</var>
to match <var class="non-terminal">Name</var> as
defined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/">XML 1.1 specification</a>.
<!--
<var class="non-terminal">NameStartChar</var> and
<var class="non-terminal">NameChar</var> are
defined in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/">XML 1.1 specification</a>.
(<em>Note:</em> 
<p>
As a matter of style, it is recommended that a <var>tagname</var>
consist of a letter, followed by zero or more letters, digits,
hyphens (<code>#\x2d</code>), or underscores (<code>#\x5f</code>).
<pre>

<!--Cowan suggested: "the cname must be a valid Scheme identifier (according to
the implementation's definition) which consists solely of characters
with Unicode general categories Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, Lo, Mn, Mc, Me, Nd, Nl,
or No (i.e. letters, combining marks, and numbers only)."
"XML special-cases hyphen, underscore, dot, and U+00B7,

The following are defined by R7RS: <var class="non-terminal">nested-comment</var>,
<var class="non-terminal">intraline-whitespace</var>,
<var class="non-terminal">line-ending</var>,
<var class="non-terminal">letter</var>,

An <var class="non-terminal">enclosed-modifier</var> is normally empty:
However, implementations or future extensions may support non-empty modifiers.
For example, Kawa supports both <code>format</code>-style
and <code>printf</code>-style specifiers, so the syntax is:
<pre>
<var class="non-terminal-def">enclosed-modifier</var> ::= <i>empty</i>
  | <code class="literal">~</code> <var class="non-terminal">format-specifier-after-tilde</var> (optional feature)

<h2 id="specification-translation">Translation</h2>
<p>
When the Scheme reader reads an <var class="non-terminal">extended-string-literal</var>
it returns a list whose first element is the symbol <code>$string$</code>,
and whose remaining elements are the translations of the string-literal parts.
The literal content (including each
<var class="non-terminal">char-ref</var> but excluding each
<var class="non-terminal">entity-ref</var>) is translated to
literal strings.
An <var class="non-terminal">entity-ref</var>
<code>&amp;<var>ename</var>;</code> is translated to a
symbol <code>$entity$:<var>ename</var></code>.
Enclosed expressions are prefixed by a <code class="literal">$&lt;&lt;$</code>
symbol¸ and followed by a <code class="literal">$&gt;&gt;$</code>.
<p>
The translation is defined by conceptual
<q>read-time re-write function</q> <b>Tr</b>
which maps an <var class="non-terminal">extended-string-literal</var>
in the input stream to an equivalent <code>$string$</code> list - which
is then (conceptually) re-read.  (A real reader would generate
S-expression forms directly, but this way we can express the
translation more concisely.)
<pre>
<b>Tr[</b><code class="literal">&amp;{</code> <var class="non-terminal">initial-ignored</var>? <var class="non-terminal">content-segment</var><sup>*</sup> <code class="literal">}</code><b>]</b>
   &#x27fe; <code class="literal">($string$</code> <b>TrContent[</b><var class="non-terminal">content-segment</var><b>]</b><sup>*</sup> <code class="literal">)</code>
</pre>
<p>
Each <q>segment</q> corresponds to a
<var class="non-terminal">string-literal-part</var> in the syntax,
except that a run of multiple plain characters and
<var class="non-terminal">char-ref</var>s are combined to a single
string literal.  In addition the <var class="non-terminal">special-escape</var>
forms are dropped without appearing in the result.
<pre>
<b>TrContent[</b>simple-text<sup>+</sup><b>]</b>
   &#x27fe; <code class="literal">&quot;</code><b> TrText[</b>simple-text<b>]</b><sup>+</sup> <code class="literal">&quot;</code>
<b>TrText[</b><i>any character except </i><code class="literal">&amp;</code><i>, or</i> <code class="literal">\</code><i>, line-ending, or final (unbalanced)</i> <code class="literal">}</code><b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; <i>that character as-is</i>
<b>TrText[</b><var>line-ending</var><b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; <code class="literal">\n</code>
<b>TrText[</b><code class="literal">\</code><b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; <code class="literal">\\</code>
<b>TrText[</b><code class="literal">&amp;#x</code> <var class="non-terminal">hex-digit</var><sup>+</sup> <code class="literal">;</code><b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; <code class="literal">\x</code> <var class="non-terminal">hex-digit</var><sup>+</sup> <code class="literal">;</code>
<b>TrText[</b><code class="literal">&amp;#</code> <var class="non-terminal">digit</var><sup>+</sup> <code class="literal">;</code><b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; <code class="literal">\x</code> <i>corresponding hex-digits</i> <code class="literal">;</code>
<b>TrText[</b><code class="literal">&amp;</code> <var class="non-terminal">nested-comment</var><b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; <code class="literal"></code>
<b>TrText[</b><var class="non-terminal">intraline-whitespace</var> <code class="literal">&amp;|</code><b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; <code class="literal"></code>

  &#x27fe; <code class="literal"></code>
</pre>
<p>
Translations for the other segment kinds are straight-forward:
<pre>
<b>TrContent[</b><code class="literal">&amp;</code><var class="non-terminal">ename</var><code class="literal">;</code><b>]</b>
   &#x27fe; <code class="literal">$entity$:</code><var class="non-terminal">ename</var>
<b>TrContent[</b><code class="literal">&amp;(</code> <var class="non-terminal">expression</var><sup>+</sup> <code class="literal">)</code><b>]</b>
   &#x27fe;  <code class="literal">$&lt;&lt;$ (</code> <var class="non-terminal">expression</var><sup>+</sup> <code class="literal">) $&gt;&gt;$</code>
<b>TrContent[</b><code class="literal">&amp;[</code></code> <var class="non-terminal">expression</var><sup>*</sup> <code class="literal">]</code><b>]</b>
   &#x27fe;  <code class="literal">$&lt;&lt;$</code> <var class="non-terminal">expression</var><sup>*</sup> <code class="literal">$&gt;&gt;$</code>
</pre>
<p>The following are optional and/or for a future specification:
<pre>
<b>TrContent[</b><code class="literal">&amp;~</code> <var class="non-terminal">format</var> <code class="literal">(</code> <var class="non-terminal">expression</var><sup>+</sup> <code class="literal">)</code><b>]</b>

   &#x27fe;  <code class="literal">($sprintf$ "</code><var class="non-terminal">format</var><code class="literal">"</code> <var class="non-terminal">expression</var><sup>+</sup> <code class="literal">)</code>
</pre>

<h2>Implementing the translated forms</h2>
The reader translation:
<pre>
($string$ <var class="non-terminal">form</var> ...)
</pre>
evaluates approximately to an immutable string created by
concatenating each <var class="non-terminal">form</var>.
A basic implementation could be:
<pre>
(define ($string$ . args)
  (let ((port (open-output-string)))
    (for-each
     (lambda (arg) (display arg port))
     args)
    (get-output-string port)))
</pre>
<p>
The string created by a <code>$string$</code> form is immutable,
and need not have a unique identity.  E.g. if the operands
are constant then an implementation is allowed to constant-fold
the expression to a string literal.
<p>
In addition <code>$&lt;&lt;$</code> <code>$&gt;&gt;$</code> are
constant unique zero-length strings.  These bindings
should preferbly be non-assignable if an implementation has
a mechanism for that (for example using identifier macros).
<pre>
(define $&lt;&lt;$ (make-string 0))
(define $&gt;&gt;$ (make-string 0))
</pre>
<p>
Note that R6RS and R7RS allows <code>eq?</code> to return <code>#t</code>
for distinct calls to <code>(make-string 0)</code>.
A hypothetical implementation
that does so needs to initialize <code>$&lt;&lt;$</code>
and <code>$&gt;&gt;$</code> some other way.
<p>
If <code>$format$</code> is supported, a minimal implementation is:
<pre>
(define-syntax $format$
  (syntax-rules ()
    (($format$ fmt arg ...)
     (format #f fmt arg ...))))
</pre>

</pre>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>
Since this specification changes the reader format, and there
is no standard Scheme way to do that, there is no portable implementation.
However, this specification is being implemented in
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/">Kawa</a>.
(Check out the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/Getting-Kawa.html">development version using Subversion</a>.)
<p>
A more sophisticated implementation of the <code>$string$</code> macro
which maps to a single <code>format</code> call is
at the time of writing
in <a href="http://sourceware.org/viewvc/kawa/trunk/kawa/lib/syntax.scm?view=co">syntax.scm</a>.


<h2>Test suite</h2>

There is a test suite in the
<a href="http://sourceware.org/viewvc/kawa/trunk/testsuite/srfi-109-test.scm?view=co">Kawa source tree</a>.
There are also <a href="http://sourceware.org/viewvc/kawa/trunk/testsuite/bad-srfi-109.scm?view=co">tests of mal-formed literals</a>.
