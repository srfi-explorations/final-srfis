<H1>Abstract</H1>

<P>
This SRFI specifies an extension to the R5RS ports that supports
several useful features: binary I/O and text I/O, bulk I/O, file
opening attributes, and bidirectional ports.  Binary I/O is provided
through byte ports which are ports whose fundamental I/O unit is an 8
bit byte.  Because characters can be encoded with bytes using a
character encoding such as ISO 8859-1, UTF-8, and UTF-16BE,
any byte port is also a character port (a port that supports the
character level I/O of R5RS).  A byte port's character encoding and
various other attributes are specified when the port is opened.
Because reasonable defaults exist, these attributes are specified
using a named optional parameter syntax.  All procedures which have
the same name as in R5RS are compatible with R5RS but may provide
additional functionality.
</P>

<H1>Rationale</H1>

<P>
The R5RS Scheme standard specifies a set of procedures to perform
input and output operations.  These operations have limited
functionality.  According to the R5RS:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To Scheme, an input port is a Scheme object that can deliver
characters upon command, while an output port is a Scheme object that
can accept characters.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The R5RS model of I/O does not provide for the following features
which are very useful in modern applications:
</P>

<OL>

<LI>
<B>External encoding of the characters.</B> In many operating systems
files are stored as sequences of 8 bit bytes.  Text files are in fact
binary files where each character is encoded using a sequence of bytes
according to some character encoding such as ISO 8859-1, UTF-8,
UTF-16BE, etc.  Normally the application must know in advance the
character encoding used by a file, but sometimes this information is
contained in the file.

<LI>
<B>Binary input and output.</B> Some files represent data using a
custom encoding.  In order to implement procedures to read and write
such data the ability to read and write individual bytes is necessary.

<LI>
<B>Bulk input and output.</B> Reading large amounts of data one byte
or character at a time is not efficient.  It is more efficient to read
and write blocks of data.

<LI>
<B>File opening attributes.</B> Many operating systems allow
attributes to be specified when a file is opened.  These attributes
affect the file opening operation and the I/O operations that follow.
For example a flag to force the creation of the file if it does not
exist, and a flag to indicate that all write operations should be done
at the end of the file.

<LI>
<B>Bidirectional ports.</B> Many operating systems have I/O devices on
which it is possible to read and to write data, for example UNIX
terminals, pipes and sockets.  Bidirectional ports are a natural
extension of the port model to support these devices.

</OL>

<P>
The Gambit Scheme system currently provides an I/O model and an API
very similar to the one specified in this SRFI.  Gambit provides many
additional I/O features that are not specified in this SRFI, such as
nonblocking I/O, process ports, TCP client and server ports, object
ports, double-ended string ports (a.k.a. pipes), <TT>`read-line'</TT>,
etc.  This is an intentional omission.  A more focused port SRFI, like
this one, has a higher likelihood of achieving widespread consensus in
the community.  The goal of this SRFI is to specify a core I/O model
and API that is compatible with R5RS but extensible.  We hope that it
will foster the development of other I/O SRFIs extending it to other
I/O requirements.
</P>

<P>
This SRFI addresses all the ``binary I/O requirements'' which the
members of the Scheme Language Editors Committee agreed were needed
for the R6RS standard.  This SRFI is a concrete proposal for an I/O
subsystem that addresses all these requirements and that conforms to
R5RS.
</P>

<H1>Specification</H1>

<P>
This SRFI assumes that SRFI 4 (Homogeneous numeric vector datatypes)
and <a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-88/">SRFI 88 (Keyword objects)</a> are supported.
</P>

<H2>Port direction</H2>

<P>
A byte port can support unidirectional I/O (i.e. input port or output
port), or bidirectional I/O (i.e. input-output port).  Bidirectional
ports can be viewed as an input port and an output port combined into
a single port object.  I/O operations on one side of a bidirectional port do
not normally affect the other side.  When an operation is said to
apply to an input port it also applies to a bidirectional port.  When
an operation is said to apply to an output port it also applies to a
bidirectional port.

</DL>

<H2>Port class hierarchy</H2>

<P>
Byte ports support character I/O operations because with each byte
port is attached a character encoding specifying how characters are
encoded with bytes.  It is incorrect to believe however that all ports
are byte ports.  For example the ``string ports'' of SRFI 6 (Basic
String Ports) have no reason to be aware of the character to byte
encoding because they only deal with sequences of characters.  So they
need not be byte ports.  For this reason this SRFI views byte ports as
a subtype of character ports.  Character ports support character I/O
operations and byte ports support character I/O operations and byte
I/O operations.  All I/O operations which are valid on a character
port are also valid on a byte port. [Although not specified in this
SRFI a further generalization is ``object ports'' which are ports
whose fundamental I/O unit is the Scheme object.  Character ports are
object ports because there is a standard encoding of (most) Scheme
objects to characters.]
</P>

The following predicates test to which port class an object belongs.

</PRE>

</DL>

<H2>Port buffering</H2>

<P>
I/O systems typically use buffering to enhance performance.  Data to
be output is accumulated in a local output buffer that is only drained
when it is full or the application explicitly requests it.  Draining
the output buffer causes the buffer's content to be passed to the
operating system which is then responsible for sending it off to the
target device (note that it is common to have other buffering layers
on the path to the device so draining an output buffer does not imply
that the device has received it).  An input buffer allows data to be
obtained in blocks from the operating system.  When the application
requests a certain amount of data, the request is served from the
input buffer if it contains all the data requested, otherwise it is
necessary to call the operating system to fill the input buffer.
</P>

<P>
In many cases buffering can be fully transparent and the application
need not be aware of its existence.  When an application mixes text
and binary I/O, or there is a dependence between the output and the
input (such as in an interactive program), buffering gets in the way
and must be taken into account by the application.  Alternatively the
simplicity of a non-buffered model can be regained by disabling the
buffering.
</P>

<P>
Character ports need buffers at the character level.  Byte ports need
buffers at the character level and at the byte level.  This is because
there is a performance advantage to encode and decode characters in
bulk to/from the byte buffer.
</P>

<DL>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>(force-output</B> [<I>port</I>]<B>)</B>

<DD>
<P>
The <I>port</I>, which defaults to the value returned by
<TT>`current-output-port'</TT>, must be an output port or
bidirectional port.  This procedure drains the character output buffer
of <I>port</I>, and then the byte output buffer of <I>port</I> if it
is a byte port.  This procedure has no effect if the port is
closed. The value returned is unspecified.
</P>

<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>(close-output-port</B> <I>port</I><B>)</B>

<DD>
<P>
As in R5RS.  Note that <TT>`close-output-port'</TT> implicitly calls
<TT>`force-output'</TT> before the port is closed.

</P>

</DL>

<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>(close-port</B> <I>port</I><B>)</B>

<DD>
<P>
When <I>port</I> is a bidirectional port, both sides of the port are
closed and the value returned is unspecified.  When <I>port</I> is a
unidirectional port, <TT>`(close-port <I>port</I>)'</TT> is equivalent
to <TT>`(close-input-port <I>port</I>)'</TT> when <I>port</I> is an
input port, and it is equivalent to <TT>`(close-output-port
<I>port</I>)'</TT> when <I>port</I> is an output port.
</P>

</DL>

<H2>Port settings</H2>

<P>
Port settings are attributes of ports which affect the I/O operations.
Port settings for a given port class are also valid for its
subclasses.  The settings are specified in a port settings list when
the port is created; those not specified default to a reasonable
value.  Keyword objects as specified in <a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-88/">SRFI 88 (Keyword objects)</a> are
used to name the settings in the port settings list.  The keyword
object is followed by the value to assign to that setting.  As a
simple example, a port can be created for the file ``foo''
using the call
</P>

<PRE>
    (open-input-file "foo")
</PRE>

<P>
This will use default settings for the character encoding, buffering,
etc.  To force the use of the UTF-8 character encoding the port could
be opened using the call
</P>

<PRE>
    (open-input-file
     (list path: "foo"
           char-encoding: 'UTF-8))
</PRE>

<P>
Here the argument of the procedure <TT>`open-input-file'</TT> has been
replaced by a port settings list which specifies the value of each
port setting that should not be set to the default value.  Note that
some port settings have no useful default and it is therefore required
to specify a value for them, such as the <TT>`path:'</TT> in the case
of the file opening procedures.  All port creation procedures take a
single argument that can either be a port settings list or a value of
a type that depends on the kind of port being created.
</P>

<P>
The reason the settings are specified using a single required
parameter rather than named optional parameters is so that the R5RS
<TT>`with-...-file'</TT> and <TT>`call-with-...-file'</TT> family of
I/O procedures can be extended with port settings while maintaining
their R5RS API (i.e. their first argument is either a string naming a
file or a port settings list).  Passing the settings as named optional
parameters after the second parameter would be awkward and hard to
read when the second parameter is a long lambda-expression.

<H3>Character port settings</H3>

<P>
The following port settings are valid for character ports and
byte ports.
</P>

<UL>

<LI>
<TT>direction:</TT> ( <TT>input</TT> | <TT>output</TT> | <TT>input-output</TT> )

<P>
This setting controls the direction of the port.  The symbol
<TT>`input'</TT> indicates a unidirectional input port, the symbol
<TT>`output'</TT> indicates a unidirectional output port, and the
symbol <TT>`input-output'</TT> indicates a bidirectional port.  The
default value of this setting depends on the port creation procedure
(for example for <TT>`open-input-file'</TT> the default is
<TT>`input'</TT> and for <TT>`open-output-file'</TT> the default is
<TT>`output'</TT>).
</P>

<LI>
<TT>input-char-buffering:</TT> ( <TT>#f</TT> | <TT>#t</TT> )

<P>
This setting controls the input character buffering of the port.  The
value <TT>`#f'</TT> disables input buffering and the value
<TT>`#t'</TT> enables input buffering.  The default value of this
setting is implementation dependent.
</P>

<LI>
<TT>output-char-buffering:</TT> ( <TT>#f</TT> | <TT>#t</TT> | <TT>line</TT> )

<P>
This setting controls the output character buffering of the port.  The
value <TT>`#f'</TT> disables output buffering and the values
<TT>`#t'</TT> and <TT>`line'</TT> enable output buffering.  When the
setting is <TT>`#f'</TT> an implicit call to <TT>`force-output'</TT>
occurs after every character output to the port.  When the setting is
<TT>`line'</TT> an implicit call to <TT>`force-output'</TT> occurs
after each <TT>`#\newline'</TT> character output to the port.
The default value of this setting is implementation dependent.
</P>

<LI>
<TT>char-buffering:</TT> ( <TT>#f</TT> | <TT>#t</TT> | <TT>line</TT> )

<P>
The setting <TT>`char-buffering'</TT> can be used to simultaneously
set the input character buffering and the output character buffering.
When <TT>`line'</TT> is used, the input character buffering is set to
<TT>`#t'</TT>.

These procedures respectively read and write a single byte from

<H2>File byte ports</H2>

<DL>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>(open-input-file</B> <I>string-or-settings</I><B>)</B>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>(open-output-file</B> <I>string-or-settings</I><B>)</B>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>(open-file</B> <I>string-or-settings</I><B>)</B>

<DD>
<P>
These procedures open a file and return a byte port.  In all cases the
single parameter can be a string naming a file, or a settings list
that indicates the file name and possibly other attributes.  The
following port settings are valid for file byte ports.
</P>

<UL>

<LI>
<TT>path:</TT> <I>string</I>

<P>
This setting indicates the location of the file in the filesystem.
There is no default value for this setting.
</P>

<LI>
<TT>append:</TT> ( <TT>#f</TT> | <TT>#t</TT> )

<P>
This setting controls whether output will be added to the end of the
file each time the output byte buffer is drained.  This is useful for
writing to log files that might be open by more than one process.  The
default value of this setting is <TT>`#f'</TT>.
</P>

<LI>
<TT>create:</TT> ( <TT>#f</TT> | <TT>#t</TT> | <TT>maybe</TT> )

<P>
This setting controls whether the file will be created when it is
opened.  A setting of <TT>`#f'</TT> requires that the file exist.  A
setting of <TT>`#t'</TT> requires that the file does not exist.  A
setting of <TT>`maybe'</TT> will create the file if it does not exist.
The default value of this setting is <TT>`maybe'</TT> for output ports
and <TT>`#f'</TT> for input ports and bidirectional ports.
</P>

<LI>
<TT>truncate:</TT> ( <TT>#f</TT> | <TT>#t</TT> )

<P>
This setting controls whether the file will be truncated when it is
opened.  For input ports, the default value of this setting is
<TT>`#f'</TT>.  For output ports, the default value of this setting is
<TT>`#t'</TT> when the <TT>`append:'</TT> setting is <TT>`#f'</TT>,
and <TT>`#f'</TT> otherwise.
</P>

</UL>

<P>
For all three procedures the settings list can specify a
<TT>`direction:'</TT> setting to select the direction of the port.
The default direction for <TT>`open-input-file'</TT> is
<TT>`input'</TT>, for <TT>`open-output-file'</TT> it is
<TT>`output'</TT>, and for <TT>`open-file'</TT> it is
<TT>`input-output'</TT>.
</P>

<P>
For file byte ports, the default character encoding is
<TT>`ISO8859-1'</TT> and the default end-of-line encoding is
<TT>`lf'</TT>.  This combination of settings matches the UNIX
conventions, and it represents an identity encoding for all characters
whose code is in the range 0 to 255.
</P>

<PRE>
(let ((p (open-file
          (list direction: 'output
                path: "mydata"
                char-encoding: 'UTF-8
                append: #t))))

<P>
These procedures are as in R5RS except the first parameter can be a
string naming a file, or a settings list which is interpreted as
above.
</P>

<H2>Changing port settings</H2>

<DL>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>(input-port-settings-set!</B> <I>port</I> <I>settings</I><B>)</B>
<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>(output-port-settings-set!</B> <I>port</I> <I>settings</I><B>)</B>

<DD>
<P>
These procedures change the settings of the <I>port</I> to
<I>settings</I>.  The settings of the port not mentioned in
<I>settings</I> keep their current value.  It is an error to mention
in <I>settings</I> a setting that cannot change, that is:
<TT>`direction:'</TT>, <TT>`path:'</TT>, <TT>`append:'</TT>,
<TT>`create:'</TT>, or <TT>`truncate:'</TT>.
</P>

<P>
When changing the character encoding or end-of-line encoding of an
output port the character output buffer is first emptied by encoding
the characters into bytes.  It is an error to change the character
encoding or end-of-line encoding of an input port when the character
input buffer is not empty.
</P>

<PRE>
(define (read-data path)
  (let ((p (open-input-file
            (list path: path
                  char-encoding: 'ISO8859-1
                  eol-encoding: 'lf
                  char-buffering: #f))))

         ((#\L) ; Latin 1
          '(char-buffering: #t))
         ((#\8) ; UTF-8
          '(char-encoding: UTF-8 char-buffering: #t))
         (else
          (error "unknown character encoding")))))
    (let* ((s (make-string 10000)) ; read up to 10000 chars
           (n (read-substring s 0 10000 p)))
      (close-port p)
      (substring s 0 n))))
</PRE>

<H1>Implementation</H1>

<P>
A fairly portable implementation of this SRFI is planned for the near
future.  The Gambit sources can be used in the meantime as a sample
implementation of this SRFI (and much more!).
