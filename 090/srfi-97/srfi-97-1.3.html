<p>Over the past ten years, numerous libraries have been specified via
the Scheme Requests for Implementation process.  Yet until the recent
ratification of the Revised<sup>6</sup> Report on the Algorithmic
Language Scheme, there has been no standardized way of distributing or
relying upon library code.  Now that such a library system exists,
there is a real need to organize these existing SRFI libraries so that
they can be portably referenced.</p>

<p>This SRFI is designed to facilitate the writing and distribution of
code that relies on SRFI libraries.  It identifies a subset of
existing SRFIs that specify features amenable to provision (and
possibly implementation) as libraries (SRFI Libraries) and proposes a
naming convention for this subset so that these libraries may be
referred to by name or by number.  

<!--
This convention represents a consensus among current R<sup>6</sup>RS
implementors.
-->

</p>

<h1><a name="rationale">Rationale</a></h1>

<p>With the advent of R<sup>6</sup>RS, it has become possible to write and
distribute portable Scheme code as libraries.  However, there is no
agreed upon way to refer to SRFI libraries, leaving implementors to
create their own conventions thus thwarting portability of code which
relies on SRFIs.  So there is an immediate and obvious need for
standardized SRFI library names.</p>

<p>The naming convention proposed in this document enjoys the
following properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>it fully conforms with the R<sup>6</sup>RS library reference
syntax,</li>

<li>it is consistent with the naming convention employed by
R<sup>6</sup>RS Standard Libraries,</li>

<li>it is based on SRFI numbers so that names for libraries can be
chosen simply and without conflict,</li>

<li>it allows (optional) mnemonic based references for readability and sub-libraries,</li>

<li>it ensures uniqueness of names over time,</li>

<li>it avoids the need for a naming authority,</li>

<li>and it represents a consensus among several Scheme implementors at the time.</li>
</ol>

<h1><a name="specification">Specification</a></h1>

<p>This specification includes the following: a library referencing
scheme for all past and future SRFI libraries, a naming convention for
selecting library names, and enumeration of library names selected for
all currently finalized SRFIs that specify libraries.</p>

<p>Although R<sup>6</sup>RS's notion of a library is the one used
here, this SRFI attempts to minimize assumptions made about a Scheme
system's conformance to R<sup>6</sup>RS so that systems may support
SRFI Libraries without needing to support all of the R<sup>6</sup>RS
library system.  In particular, the <code>for</code> clause is not
needed for any existing SRFI Library, and versioning information is
not used.  This is important for systems such as ERR<sup>5</sup>RS,
which do not support these features.</p>

<h2><a name="referencing">Referencing SRFI Libraries</a></h2>

<p>The purpose of this SRFI is to name SRFI libraries in a consistent
and uniform manner, both in the case of existing SRFIs and in the case
of SRFIs yet to be written.</p>

<p>A SRFI library reference consists of two required components:</p>

<ul>
<li>the identifier <code>srfi</code>,</li>
<li>and the SRFI number, represented as the identifier <code>:<em>n</em></code>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="discussionnote"><em>Discussion:</em> Several current Scheme
implementations supporting SRFIs use names consisting of
<code>srfi</code> and the relevant SRFI number.  For example, Larceny,
PLT Scheme, Scheme 48 all do. Use of these components also has
precedents in SRFIs 0 and 7.</p>

<p class="discussionnote"><em>Discussion:</em> Since this SRFI is
<em>only concerned</em> with the naming of SRFI libraries, the
<code>srfi</code> prefix is included to clearly distinguish it as a
SRFI reference, and the number component is included to disambiguate
among SRFIs, while allowing for simple naming without clashes or
authorities.  During the discussion period, it was made clear some
would prefer libraries not be distinguished as SRFIs and that names be
strictly mnemonic. Such a requirement broadens the scope of this
proposal from a convention for SRFI libraries to the more general case
of Scheme libraries and poses a much more difficult problem to solve.
Instead, the particular problem is solved in such a way as to
hopefully not interfere with future more general naming
conventions.</p>

<p>Additionally, a SRFI library reference consists of one or more
optional mnemonic components following the naming convention described
below.</p>

<p>
A SRFI library reference has the following form,

<blockquote>
<code>(srfi :<em>&lt;uinteger 10&gt;</em> <em>&lt;identifier&gt;</em> ...)</code>,
</blockquote>

where <code><em>&lt;identifier&gt;</em></code> is one of the included
SRFI library names defined below, and <code><em>&lt;uinteger
10&gt;</em></code> is a SRFI number.  The non-terminals
<code>&lt;uinteger 10&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;identifier&gt;</code>
are defined as given in R<sup>6</sup>RS <a
href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs/r6rs-Z-H-7.html#node_chap_4">Chapter
4, Lexical syntax</a>.</p>

<p class="discussionnote">
<em>Discussion:</em> The colon (<tt>:</tt>) prefix is used in order to
make the SRFI number component an identifier, as required by
R<sup>6</sup>RS.  Several Scheme implementors expressed the importance
of R<sup>6</sup>RS conformance and supported the colon prefix as a
reasonable, if somewhat arbitrary, way to render the number as an
identifier.  The issue of mapping library references to file paths is
left completely unspecified by this SRFI and R<sup>6</sup>RS.</p>

A SRFI Library can be referenced by number, as in
<blockquote>
<code>(srfi :1)</code>,
</blockquote>
or equivalently using the library's name, as in
<blockquote>
<code>(srfi :1 lists)</code>.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p class="discussionnote">
<em>Discussion:</em>
Even though the latter uses a library name, the SRFI number must still
be supplied.  This is done to ensure <em>fairness</em> and
<em>uniqueness</em>&mdash;a SRFI should not be able to prevent other
SRFIs from using the same name, but at the same time, SRFI library
references should remain unambiguous.
</p>

<p class="discussionnote">
<em>Discussion:</em> Since the number-only naming scheme ensures both
<em>uniqueness</em> and <em>fairness</em>, the named-library scheme is
redundant, but it is included to make library imports more readable.
Although the same could be achieved via a comment, comments are not
checked.  The named-library scheme can thus be used to increase the
likelihood that the correct library is imported.
</p>

<p>The remaining identifier subforms are used to name sublibraries
within a SRFI Library.  For example, SRFI 41, Streams, defines
<code>primitive</code> and <code>derived</code> libraries within the
<code>streams</code> library.  These can be referenced as
<blockquote>
<code>(srfi :41 streams primitive)</code>,<br/>
<code>(srfi :41 streams derived)</code>.
</blockquote>
</p>



<h2><a name="naming">Naming convention</a></h2>

<p>Mnemonic library names are chosen according to the following
conventions: Libraries that define datatypes are typically pluralized
(e.g., <code>arrays</code>, <code>basic-string-ports</code>).
Libraries that provide new expression forms are named by the name of
their new form (e.g., <code>let-values</code>, <code>rec</code>,
<code>and-let*</code>).  Libraries that define a single procedure (or
that have a primary procedure) are given the name of the procedure
(e.g., <code>error</code>, <code>cat</code>).  Libraries that provide
a large API of syntaxes and values are named in a descriptive manner
derived from their title (e.g., <code>lightweight-testing</code>,
<code>real-time-multithreading</code>).  This naming convention is
consistent with the names chosen in the R<sup>6</sup>RS Standard
Libraries.</p>

<p class="discussionnote"><em>Discussion:</em> Some authors specified
names that should be used for libraries. These names are not used
here.  Instead, a consistent naming scheme is used that happens to
differ from the authors' originally chosen names.</p>

<p class="discussionnote"> <em>Discussion:</em> There is opportunity
for grouping related SRFIs together.  For example, SRFI 28, Basic
Format Strings, and SRFI 48, Intermediate Format Strings, could be
grouped into a common <code>format</code> library with
<code>simple</code> and <code>intermediate</code> components.  This
has been avoided, preferring instead to follow a <em>one SRFI, one
(top-level) library</em> convention.  Although within a single SRFI,
several sub-libraries can be defined, thus achieving grouping.  This
simplifies the naming convention and prevents the need for a naming
authority which decides what shall and shall not be grouped together.
Instead, grouping must be achieved by the SRFI process, as it should.
</p>

<h2><a name="included">Included SRFIs</a></h2>

<p>The criterion for inclusion in the set of SRFI Libraries is that
the finalized SRFI only specify a set of bindings which can be
provided as a library.  SRFI Libraries need not be implementable as an
R<sup>6</sup>RS library, but they must specify an interface which could be used
<em>as if it were</em>.  This means, for example, that lexical syntax
extensions cannot be a part of a SRFI Library.  SRFIs that specify
global semantic changes to Scheme also cannot be SRFI Libraries.  For
example, a Lazy Scheme SRFI or a SRFI that fixed order of evaluation
in procedure application could not be a SRFI Library because these
features cannot be provided as a set of bindings.</p>

<p>Some SRFIs specify alternative semantics to standard Scheme
bindings.  In some cases, such as SRFI 5's <code>let</code>, it's
clear that making the alternative binding for <code>let</code>
available as a library binding is desirable.  Authors that wish to
use SRFI 5's <code>let</code>, rather than R<sup>6</sup>RS's <code>let</code>,
simply import the SRFI 5 binding and exclude the R<sup>6</sup>RS binding for
<code>let</code> (or rename to avoid the clash).</p>

<p>Other SRFIs, however, define alternative bindings that are intended
to be used throughout a Scheme system.  For example, SRFI 63's
<code>equal?</code> and most of SRFI 70, Numbers, are defined like this.
But if the author intends for these bindings to <em>replace</em> the
standard bindings, then there is no way of making this feature
available as a library, so the SRFI cannot be a SRFI Library.
</p>

<p>The approach taken in this SRFI is that a SRFI is excluded as a
SRFI Library if it explicitly states the binding is to replace the
standard one.  For example, SRFI 70, Numbers, is excluded because it
explicitly revises the text of R<sup>5</sup>RS, thus intending to make
a global semantic change to the language which cannot be provided as a
library.  On the other hand, SRFI 63, Homogeneous and Heterogeneous
Arrays, is included and provides a binding for <code>equal?</code>
because the SRFI 63 document does not explicitly state this should
replace the standard <code>equal?</code> binding.</p>

</table>


For the purposes of R<sup>6</sup>RS conforming systems, export levels
are assumed to be 0 for all exported bindings of all SRFIs,
<em>except</em> SRFI-46: Basic syntax-rules extensions, which should
export <tt>syntax-rules</tt> for level&nbsp;1.  This allows all
existing SRFI Libraries to be portably imported and used without use
of the R<sup>6</sup>RS <tt>for</tt> clause.


<h2><a name="omitted">Omitted SRFIs</a></h2>

<p>
SRFIs are not libraries, they are requests for <em>features</em>.
Thus, several SRFIs specify features which cannot be provided as a
library and those SRFIs are intentionally omitted here.  For example,
SRFIs which specify extensions to concrete syntax or extensions to the
semantics of top-level programs cannot be provided as libraries and
are therefore omitted from this SRFI.  The following table lists
omitted (finalized) SRFIs and the reason for their omission.<p>

<h2><a name="withdrawn">Withdrawn SRFIs</a></h2>

Withdrawn SRFIs are considered outside the scope of this proposal, so
their names are not considered.

<h2><a name="future">Future SRFIs</a></h2>

<p>Authors of future SRFIs that specify libraries may choose names as
they please, but they are encouraged to use library names following
the naming convention of this SRFI.  If names are chosen that are not
compatible with the referencing scheme given here, authors should
specify alternative names that can be used to refer to the library
consistent with this specification.

<p>SRFI 41, Streams, for example, specifies that its libraries are
named by <code>(streams)</code>, <code>(streams primitive)</code>, and
<code>(streams derived)</code>, but according to this SRFI, they must
also be named with the prefix <code>(srfi :41 *)</code>.

<h2><a name="existing">Issues with existing SRFIs and R<sup>6</sup>RS</a></h2>

<p>There are many issues involved in the use and implementation of
some of the existing SRFIs in an R<sup>6</sup>RS or related system.
This SRFI resolves none of them.</p>

<p>See the discussion archive and previous revisions of this document
for a list of some of these issues.</p>

<h2><a name="relation">Relation to SRFIs 0 and 7</a></h2>

<p>Both SRFI 0, Feature-based conditional expansion construct, and
SRFI 7, Feature-based program configuration language, use <em>feature
identifiers</em> of the form <code>srfi-N</code>, with the expectation
"that features will eventually be assigned meaningful names (aliases)
by the SRFI editors to make reading and writing code less tedious than
when using <code>srfi-N</code> feature identifiers."</p>

<p>It is recommended that implementations which support SRFIs 0 or 7
use the SRFI names defined here as aliases.  SRFI feature identifiers
are constructed by
<ol>
<li>interpolating library references with a hyphen
(<code>-</code>),</li>
<li>interpreting the SRFI number component of a library reference "<code>:<em>n</em></code>" as "<code><em>n</em></code>".</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, the feature identifier for SRFI 1,
List Library, is <code>srfi-1</code>, or equivalently,
<code>srfi-1-lists</code>.  Feature identifiers for sub-libraries are
constructed in the same way, so for example the feature identifier for
the streams primitive library is
<code>srfi-41-streams-primitive</code>.
</p>
