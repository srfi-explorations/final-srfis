<h1><a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h1>

<p>This SRFI defines a standard for naming and finding files containing
libraries.  It is intended for implementations of the R6RS, and perhaps other
Scheme dialects, so that libraries stored in contemporary file systems may be
made available for importing.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<h1><a name="rationale">Rationale</a></h1>

<p>The <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/">R6RS</a> does not specify how libraries
are to be made available for importing.  In order for libraries to be portably
organized, distributed, installed, and available for importing, using
contemporary file systems, a standard is needed for naming and finding the files
containing libraries.</p>

<p>R6RS library names and library references as defined by
<a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs/r6rs-Z-H-10.html#node_sec_7.1">R6RS
7.1</a> are compound and consist of a list of one or more symbols and an
optional last element of either a version or a version reference.  The compound
nature of the names allows for hierarchical grouping of libraries under shared
name prefixes, which is useful for avoiding name conflicts with others'
libraries and for organizing related libraries.  A list of symbols closely
matches a file system path because a path is a sequence of strings naming an
entity in a hierarchy of directories.  Most (if not all) implementations of R6RS
had already exploited this obvious match and provided methods of finding
library files based on libraries' names by using each symbol component as a path
component.  However, implementations' rules for naming and finding library
files were not the same, and this lack of coherency began to frustrate attempts
at distributing and using library files in a portable way.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<h1><a name="design">Design</a></h1>

<p>Prior to this SRFI, most implementations expected library files to each
contain only one library.  However, at least one implementation, Larceny,
supported files containing multiple libraries.  Single-library files have
advantages over multiple-library files: (1) the process for finding libraries is
not as complex; (2) when people want to find the files containing specific
libraries, they do not have to hunt them down by identifying the many
possibilities and checking each; (3) it is possible to map library file paths to
library names and so know what library a file contains without having to look in
it, which is useful for managing library files; (4) editors', version control
systems', and other tools' file organization abilities can more naturally be
used to organize work with particular libraries.  For these reasons, this SRFI
has single-library files only.</p>

<p>Prior to this SRFI, implementations supported search paths which are
configurable path prefixes under which library files are looked for.  In
addition to allowing library files' locations to be configurable, search paths
allow the possibility of configuring multiple implementations to use the same
search path(s) and thus use the same directories and files containing libraries.
This is desirable both for avoiding duplicating directories and files and for
being able to add or remove library files by simply putting them into or
deleting them from the search path(s) which all the implementations are already
configured to use and so no further configuration or clean-up is required.  For
these reasons, this SRFI has search paths and initializes them from an
environment variable which all implementations use.</p>

<p>Symbols may contain characters which may not be allowed in paths of some file
systems or which are interpreted specially in paths.  Prior to this SRFI,
implementations encoded some characters in library file paths.  However, their
encoding schemes were not the same.  This SRFI has an encoding scheme which
requires encoding only four characters and is intended to allow using all other
characters a file system supports, instead of being forced to encode some
characters unnecessarily, while still being able to exchange library files with
others who encode a different set of characters.</p>

<p>To support selecting implementation-specific libraries from among other
libraries with the same names but for other implementations, prior to this SRFI,
most (if not all) implementations had an additional rule for finding library
files.  This rule is that the file name extension has an additional component
prepended to it, and this component is the name of the implementation, and files
with the implementation-specific extension and files with only the basic
unspecific extension are chosen, and files with an extension specific to other
implementations are ignored.  This allows for structuring libraries such that
portable interfaces to implementation-specific features can be made.  Also, this
allows for structuring library files such that implementation-specific libraries
can be used in preference over generic libraries.  By using the file name
extension to accomplish this, files containing libraries named the same can be
kept in the same directory and kept organized with other related libraries.  By
providing implementation-specific functionality via the same library name and
interface, importing source code remains portable and does not need to be
changed to support new implementations because all that is required is to add a
file for a new implementation.  However, implementations which did not encode
the extension separator character suffered from allowing conflicts with some
possible library names.  For these reasons, this SRFI has
implementation-specific file name extentions and encodes the extension separator
character.</p>

<p>R6RS library names may contain a version and library references may contain a
version reference.  This is useful for referencing libraries with a constraint
on what versions are acceptable, which is useful when a library changes and
users want to ensure only acceptable versions are used.  Some users do not care
for versions in library names or references.  Prior to this SRFI,
implementations' rules for naming and finding files containing versioned
libraries were not the same.  For these reasons, this SRFI has a scheme for
versions in library file names and supports both using versions and not using
them.</p>

<p>To support organizing all the files of libraries with a shared name prefix
under the same directory, prior to this SRFI, some implementations had an
additional rule for finding library files.  This rule is that an additional path
component is implicitly appended to library file paths so that the last symbol
of a library name corresponds to the last directory containing a library's file.
E.g., a library named <code>(acme)</code> can have its file under the same
<code>"/search/path/acme"</code> directory as the file for a library named
<code>(acme foo bar)</code>, or a library named <code>(acme foo)</code> can have
its file in the same <code>"/search/path/acme/foo"</code> directory as the file
for a library named <code>(acme foo helper)</code>.  This is useful for
organizing library files, especially for distributing library collections (or
sub-collections) as a single tree of directories and files all under one top
directory named after the libraries' shared name prefix (which is often also the
name of the collection).  Also, this allows such library collections to be
simply put in a search path directory and be immediately available.  However,
implementations' rules for implicit file names were not the same.  For these
reasons, this SRFI has implicit file names.</p>

<p>Taking into account all possible combinations of the above features had not
been coordinated between implementations and so they likely were not the same in
how they handled various combinations.  This might have caused further
portability problems.  This SRFI offers the above features in an integrated and
standard way.</p>

<p>This SRFI requires library file paths to exactly and unambiguously represent
the library name of the library a file contains.  This supports: (1) mapping
library file paths to library names, including library file paths which include
a search path; (2) finding library files by only their paths, i.e., without
needing to read the files; (3) multiple versions of a library having their files
in the same directory; (4) extracting the search path from library file paths
which include a search path.  Points 1, 2, and 3 require including the version
in the file name of libraries with a version in their name.  Points 1 and 4
require search paths to be independent of each other.</p>

<p>A version reference may allow more than one version.  A collection of import
forms may contain multiple references to the same library but with different
version constraints.  The collection of library files available in a particular
host may contain multiple versions of a library.  These facts together cause a
challenging problem: choosing a set of libraries which satisfy all the combined
version constraints of all the import forms.  All the possibilities of version
constraints combinations and transitive imports, and differences in the nature
of different implementations, can make choosing a set of libraries quite
complicated and make requiring a particular method undesirable.  For this
reason, this SRFI specifies an ordering of library files matching a library
reference.  This ordering is intended to be used as the precedence for choosing
a match.  This is intentionally left vague because implementations need the
freedom to handle this issue in their own way.  This SRFI's ordering is
intended to be referred to by particular implementations in how they handle this
issue.  This ordering may also be useful for managing library files.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<h1><a name="specification">Specification</a></h1>

<h3><a name="library-files">Library Files</a></h3>

<p>Library files are files which contain one library form as the first syntactic
datum, and they are files whose path exactly represents the name of the
contained library.  Any additional contents after the first datum are ignored by
this SRFI.  Determining files' contents' character encoding is not handled by
this SRFI.</p>

<p>A library file path consists of, in order: possibly a search path
prefix, a sequence of path components corresponding to the sequence of symbols
in the contained library's name, possibly an implicitly added last path
component with prefix <code>"^main^"</code>, possibly a version in the last path
component if the library name has a version, possibly an implementation name in
the last path component, and the file name extension <code>"sls"</code>.  Path
components are separated by a platform-dependent character.
The <code>#\.</code>  character is used in the last path component to separate
the prefix, the version, the version parts, the implementation name, and
the <code>"sls"</code> extension.</p>

<p>A relative library file path is a library file path without a search path
prefix.  An absolute library file path is a library file path with a search path
prefix.</p>

<h3><a name="search-paths">Search Paths</a></h3>

<p>Search paths are paths grouped in a sequence.  They must name directories.
When finding library files, they are prefixed to relative library file paths to
form absolute library file paths which are possible locations of library files.
Search paths must be independent, i.e., one cannot be a prefix of another, so
that the paths of library files unambiguously represent library names.  If the
search paths were not independent, it could be ambiguous what library name a
path represents.  Search paths may share a prefix as long as their tails differ.
E.g., paths <code>"/foo/bar"</code> and <code>"/foo/bar/zab"</code> are not
independent and so the library name represented by path
<code>"/foo/bar/zab/asdf.sls"</code> is ambiguous because it might be
<code>(zab asdf)</code> or <code>(asdf)</code>, but paths
<code>"/foo/bar/blah"</code> and <code>"/foo/bar/zab"</code> do not cause
ambiguity and so are allowed.</p>

<p>The operating system environment variable
<code>SCHEME_LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS</code>, if it is defined, is used to
initialize the search paths.  Its value is a string containing a sequence of
paths separated by a platform-dependent character.  The order of the sequence is
preserved in the sequence of search paths.  Implementations may initialize the
search paths to include additional paths before or after those from the
environment variable, such as paths given on the command line which are before,
or system default paths which are after.</p>

<p>The sequential ordering of search paths provides search path precedence which
allows overlaying or overriding library files.  Multiple searched directories
can contain different files for the same libraries, and the files in directories
with greater precedence have greater precedence.  This can be exploited to
extend and/or override the set of available library files, without modifying
existing file system entities, by placing the new library files in similarly
structured directory trees located under new search paths with greater
precedence.</p>

<h3><a name="encoding">Encoding Characters</a></h3>

<p>Encoding characters in components of relative library file paths is necessary
to avoid conflicts with the characters this SRFI uses specially, and it is also
done to support the use of characters a file system may not support.  The
special characters of this SRFI are: <code>#\%</code>, the path separator,
<code>#\.</code>, and <code>#\^</code>.  Technically, only the last path
component needs all four characters to be encoded, and non-last path components
need only <code>#\%</code> and the path separator to be encoded.  However, all
four characters are always encoded, to avoid causing an exceptional case for the
last path component.  Additional characters may also be encoded.  Communicating
what characters must be encoded for different file systems and coordinating
transcoding of path names is not handled by this SRFI.</p>

<p>Characters are encoded using their UTF-8 encoding such that each UTF-8 byte
is represented as two hexadecimal digits, with alphabetic digits in upper case,
preceded by the <code>#\%</code> character.  This type of encoding is chosen
because it follows URI encoding.  E.g., a library named
<code>(a%b c/d e.f g^h)</code> may be in a file with path
<code>"/search/path/a%25b/c%2Fd/e%2Ef/g%5Eh.sls"</code>, and a library named
<code>(♥ λ)</code> may be in a file with path <code>"/search/path/♥/λ.sls"</code>
or <code>"/search/path/%E2%99%A5/%CE%BB.sls"</code>.</p>

<h3><a name="extension">File Name Extension</a></h3>

<p>This SRFI uses <code>"sls"</code> as the file name extension of library
files, because "S.L.S." is the acronym of "Scheme library source".  The
extension may have an optional implementation-specific component, and this
component should be the name of the Scheme implementation a library file is for.
For implementation-specific library files, the implementation-specific component
is prepended to <code>".sls"</code> to form the complete extension.  For library
files not specific to an implementation, only <code>"sls"</code> is used.  E.g.,
for an implementation named <code>"acme"</code>, a library named
<code>(foo)</code> may be in a file with path
<code>"/search/path/foo.acme.sls"</code> or <code>"/search/path/foo.sls"</code>,
and a library named <code>(foo.acme)</code> may be in a file with path
<code>"/search/path/foo%2Eacme.acme.sls"</code> or
<code>"/search/path/foo%2Eacme.sls"</code>.  Encoding the <code>#\.</code>
character avoids conflict because the files for the two libraries can be
named <code>"/search/path/foo.acme.sls"</code> and
<code>"/search/path/foo%2Eacme.sls"</code>.</p>

<p>In order to avoid conflicts, the special characters of this SRFI and the
characters <code>#\0</code> through <code>#\9</code> are always encoded in an
implementation-specific component of an extension.  Any additional characters
configured to be encoded are also encoded.  E.g., for an implementation
named <code>"a%b/c.d^e"</code>, a library named <code>(foo)</code> may be in a
file with path <code>"/search/path/foo.a%25b%2Fc%2Ed%5Ee.sls"</code>.  This way,
conflict with the special characters is avoided.  For an implementation named
<code>"123"</code>, a library named <code>(foo)</code> may be in a file with
path <code>"/search/path/foo.%31%32%33.sls"</code>.  This way, conflict with
version components of file names is avoided.  For an implementation named
<code>"それ"</code>, a library named <code>(foo)</code> may be in a file with
path <code>"/search/path/foo.それ.sls"</code> or
<code>"/search/path/foo.%E3%81%9D%E3%82%8C.sls"</code>.  This way,
implementation names with characters not supported by a file system can be
used.</p>

<h3><a name="versioning">Versioning</a></h3>

<p>If a library's name includes a version then its file name must include the
version.  Versions in library file paths are placed in the last path component
after the file name prefix and before the file name extension, and they are
separated from other file name components by the <code>#\.</code> character and
their sub-parts are also separated by this character.  E.g., a library named 
<code>(foo (5))</code> may be in a file with path 
<code>"/search/path/foo/^main^.5.sls"</code>, and a library named 
<code>(bar zab (1 2 3))</code> may be in a file with path
<code>"/search/path/bar/zab.1.2.3.sls"</code>.  Versions in file names are
always distinguishable from implementation-specific components of extensions
because versions in file names must use only the characters <code>#\0</code>
through <code>#\9</code> and <code>#\.</code>, and implementation-specific
components of extensions must encode these characters and so conflicts are not
possible.</p>

<p>A library file without a version matches a library reference regardless of
its version reference (if everything else about the file's path matches).  This
does not conform to R6RS, and the rationale for this is it allows supplying a
library without a version which fulfills a library reference without regard for
its version reference.  This is symmetrical with R6RS specifying that a library
reference without a version reference will match a library with a version.</p>

<h3><a name="implicit-main">Implicit File Name</a></h3>

<p>An implicit file name is a library file path with a last path component with
prefix <code>"^main^"</code>.  This is considered implicit because it is not
derived from a library name.  Implicit file names allow the last directory
containing a library file to be named according to the last symbol of a library
name.  There are two possible paths under a search path for a file for a
library: one with the implicit component and one without.  The prefix of the
implicit component must avoid conflicts with library names.  This is
accomplished by encoding <code>#\^</code> characters of relative library file
paths.  E.g., a library named <code>(foo)</code> may be in a file with path
<code>"/search/path/foo/^main^.sls"</code> or
<code>"/search/path/foo.sls"</code>, and a library named
<code>(foo ^main^)</code> may be in a file with path
<code>"/search/path/foo/%5Emain%5E/^main^.sls"</code> or
<code>"/search/path/foo/%5Emain%5E.sls"</code>.  This way, conflict is avoided
because the files for the two libraries can be named
<code>"/search/path/foo/^main^.sls"</code> and
<code>"/search/path/foo/%5Emain%5E.sls"</code>.</p>

<p>The prefix <code>"^main^"</code> is chosen because implicit components are
usually used for libraries which are the main library of a group, and a
protector character which is encoded is used to avoid conflicts as just shown,
and <code>"^main^"</code> visually stands out, and the <code>#\^</code>
character is not a common character in library name symbols and it does not
require escaping when used in common command shells.</p>

<h3><a name="ordering">Ordering</a></h3>

<p>A library reference may match multiple files which each contain an
implementation of the library.  This SRFI specifies an ordering for all the
possibilities of matching files.  Scheme implementations should use this
ordering as the precedence for choosing a match.  This SRFI does not specify
which match is chosen, because choosing the files to use for a set of transitive
imports involves implementation-dependent complications and choosing the matches
which satisfy all the version constraints needs to be left to each
implementation.</p>

<p>Multiple files matching a library reference is possible because of: multiple
search paths each containing matches, implicit file name matches and
non-implicitly-named matches both existing, multiple versions of the library
matching the library reference's version reference, and implementation-specific
and unspecific matches both existing.  This SRFI uses a multi-level ordering to
deal with all these aspects.  The first level is search paths, the second level
is implicit naming of files, the third level is versions, and the fourth level
is implementation-specific files.</p>

<p>Matches in a search path which is ordered before another search path
are ordered before matches in the other search path.</p>

<p>Within the same search path, implicit file name matches are ordered before
non-implicitly-named matches.</p>

<p>Within the same directory, matches are ordered first by version and second by
implementation specificity.  A match without a version is ordered before a match
with a version, and a match with a greater version is ordered before a match
with a lesser version, regardless of whether either match has the
implementation-specific file name extension.  Matches with a version are ordered
by the usual version ordering.  E.g., the version <code>2</code> is greater
than <code>1.2.3</code> which is greater than <code>1.2.0</code> which is
greater than <code>1.2</code>.  Matches with the same version, or no version,
are relatively ordered by whether or not they are specific to the
implementation; the match which is specific is ordered before the match which is
not.  (Ordering files which are specific to different implementations is not
necessary because the only files which can match are those which are not
specific or are specific to the implementation being used.)</p>

<h1><a name="companion-srfi">Companion SRFI</a></h1>

<p>
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-104/srfi-104.html">SRFI 104: Library Files
Utilities</a> is a companion to this SRFI.  It is the reference implementation
of this SRFI, and it is intended to be useful as a means for Scheme
implementations to support this SRFI, and it is a library intended to be useful
to users working with library files.  It is separate from this SRFI so that this
SRFI is abstract and does not require providing a library API and may be
provided without providing the companion SRFI.  It is intended to be useful on
implementations supporting this SRFI, whether or not they use it to implement
this SRFI.  E.g., it can be used to do transcoding of path names when exchanging
library files between different file systems.
</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<h1><a name="issues">Issues</a></h1>

<p>
(Section which points out things to be resolved.  This will not appear in the
final SRFI.)
</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Should R6RS's peculiar version reference syntax and semantics be used,
  or should a more straightforward design be used instead?  This SRFI already
  differs from R6RS in that a non-empty version reference will match a library
  with no declared version.</p></li>

  <li><p>TODO: Anything else?</p></li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="acknowledgements">Acknowledgments</a></h1>

<p>I thank Aziz Ghuloum and Will Clinger for starting the
implementation-specific file name extension idea.  I thank PLT Scheme for the
ideas of implicit main files and URI-style UTF-8 encoding.  I thank Michael
Sperber for convincing me to not specify choosing what files to use for a full
transitive import set.  I thank all those who participated during the draft
period of this SRFI and all those who participated in earlier discussions in
various other forums.  I thank David Van Horn for editing this SRFI and for
suggesting it be separated from its companion SRFI.</p>
