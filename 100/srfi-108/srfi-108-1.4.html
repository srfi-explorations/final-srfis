<H1>Abstract</H1>
<p>
This specifies an extensible reader syntax for
named value constructors.
A reader prefix is followed by a <q>tag</q> (an identifier),
and then expressions and literal text parameters.
The tag can be though of as a class name, and the expression and
literal text are arguments to an object constructor call.
The reader translates <code>&amp;<var>tag</var>{...}</code> to a list
<code>($construct$:<var>tag</var> ...)</code>,
where <code>$construct$:<var>tag</var></code>
is normally bound to a predefined macro.
<p>
This propsal depends on
<a href="../srfi-109/srfi-109.html">SRFI-109 (extended string quasi-literals)</a> (in spite of having a lower number).
It also shares quite of bit of syntax with
<a href="../srfi-107/srfi-107.html">SRFI-107 (XML reader syntax)</a>.

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<h2>Named (quasi-)literals</h2>
<p>
When adding new datatypes it is useful to add new literals of that type,
or at least a compact readable notation for creating instances.
<a "http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-10/srfi-10.html">SRFI-10</a> provided
one solution.  Here is an example, which assumes a URI
type for representing encoded Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs - or
generalized URLs):
<pre>
#,(URI "http://example.com/")
</pre>
<p>
SRFI-10 has a number of problems.  One issue
is that SRFI-10 conflicts with <code>syntax-case</code> and R6RS.
More fundamentally SRFI-10 resolves the <q>tag</q> name to a
constructor function at read time, which requires managing those
names using a distinct mechanism.  It seems better to use normal
scope rules (including library import) to manage this mapping.
The reader is also responsible for calling the constructor,
which means the format handled by <code>read</code> is extensible,
which is good, but you have to be careful about the security
implications, making sure only <q>safe</q> constructor functions are called.
Finally, SRFI-10 doesn't integrate with quasi-quotation,
and some of us find its syntax a bit ugly.
<p>
Instead, this SRFI proposes:
<pre>
&amp;URI{http://example.com/}
</pre>
<p>
The Scheme reader translates this to:
<pre>
($construct$:URI "http://example.com/")
</pre>
The programmer must provide or import a macro or procedure definition
of <code>$construct$:URI</code> that creates a URI value.
<p>
As related prior art, Caml p4 has an interesting
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/tutorial-camlp4/tutorial004.html">quotation system</a>.
<h2>Enclosed unquoted expressions</h2>
The arguments to the object initializer aren't always constant.
Escaped expressions can be written thus:
<pre>
(define example-host "example.com")
&amp;URI{http://&amp;[example-host]/}
</pre>
<p>
Note that <code class="literal">&amp;</code>
is used both to introduce the top-level quasi-literal,
and as an escape character before the unquoted expression.
<p>
The above example is read as:
<pre>
($construct$:URI "http://" $&lt;&lt;$ example-host $&gt;&gt;$ "/")
</pre>
The symbols <code>$&lt;&lt;$</code> and <code>$&gt;&gt;$</code> are special
<q>marker</q> symbols whose pre-defined value is the empty string.
Their use allows the implementation of <code>$construct$:URI</code>
to tell if content is part of the literal text or from an
enclosed expression - which is sometimes useful to know.
<p>
Note that enclosed expressions are commonly strings but not always.
This example executes an SQL query with a numeric parameter:
<pre>
&amp;sql{select * from employees where salary &gt; &amp;[min-salary]}
</pre>
Even when the parameter is a string, simple string pasting
may be wrong - or dangerous:
Consider:
<pre>
&amp;sql{select * from employees where name = '&amp;[my-name]'}
</pre>
<p>
Consider what happens if <var>name</var> is constructed by a malicious
user and has the value: <code class="literal">smith' or ''='</code>.  In that case the effective condition
would be:
<pre>
name = 'smith' or ''=''
</pre>
This evaluates to true so it would retrieve all <code>employees</code>.
The use of <code>$&lt;&lt;$</code> and <code>$&gt;&gt;$</code>
enables the <code>$construct$:sql</code> implementation
to do the necessary escaping of special characters in text
resulting from an evaluated expression.
<!--
<p>
An example with enclosed expressions:
<pre>
&amp;cname{abc&amp;[exp1]def&amp;[exp2 exp3]ghi}
</pre>
is translated by the reader to:
<pre>
($construct$:cname "abc" $&lt;&lt;$ exp1 $&gt;&gt;$ "def" $&lt;&lt;$ exp2 exp3 $&gt;&gt;$ "ghi")
</pre>
-->
<!--
<p>The name <code>extended-syntax-handler</code> is resolved
in the normal lexical scope, and thus can be defined in a library.
The default binding <code>extended-syntax-handler</code>
is <code>extended-syntax-handler-default</code>,
which is partly implementation-defined (see later ???).
-->

<h2>Initial arguments</h2>
It is convenient to directly support initial unquoted expressions.
Instead of:
<pre>
&amp;cname{&amp;[exp1 exp2]text}
</pre>
you can write:
<pre>
&amp;cname[exp1 exp2]{text}
</pre>
<p>These are almost the same, but there is conceptual
difference: The latter variant is typically used for options
or XML-style attributes. The former variant
is used to list <q>components</q> of the result object,
or <q>children</q> in the XML sense.
Initial expressions can be used for keyword arguments - or
general non-string arguments.
Here is an example (converted from the Scribble documentation):
<pre>
&amp;elem[style: 'italic]{Yummy!}
</pre>
<p>
Consider objects that are normally constructed from a string representation.
In that case one might want to concatenate the non-initial enclosed
expressions along with the literal text to yield the string,
while using initial arguments for keywords or non-string arguments.
Therefore the <code>$construct$:cname</code> implementation
needs to be able to unambiguously select the initial arguments.
To do this, the first example in this section is read as
<pre>
($construct$:cname $&lt;&lt;$ exp1 exp2 $&gt;&gt;$ "text")
</pre>
while the second is read as:
<pre>
($construct$:cname exp1 exp2 $&gt;&gt;$ "text")
</pre>
i.e. without the initial <code class="literal">$&lt;&lt;$</code> symbol.
Commonly both expressions will evaluate to
the same value, but that is not required.

<h2>Document processing</h2>

One intended application for this extension is document markup.
The <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/">Scribble</a> system
defines a syntax used for writing documents, though it has
other uses.  It is a kind of template
processor with embedded expression in the Racket Scheme dialect.
The general Racket syntax for an embedded expression is:
<pre>
@<var>cmd</var>[<var>datum</var> ...]{<var>text-body</var>}
</pre>
This SRFI uses <code class="literal">&amp;</code> instead of <code class="literal">@</code>, to
be compatible with XML-literals, and also because the proposed syntax
is similar but not fully compatible with Scribble.
Non-compatible cases include <code>@{foo bar}</code>
which Scribble reads as <code>("foo bar")</code>,
while SRFI-109 instead defines this as the string
<code>"foo bar"</code>.
<p>
Markup is commonly nested, which suggests that a
<code class="literal">&amp;</code> in text can be used
as an abbreviated <var class="nonterminal"><a href="#extended-datum-literal-def">extended-datum-literal</a></var>.
Specifically:
<pre>
&amp;name1[exps]{abc&amp;name2[exps]{klm}xyz}
</pre>
is syntatic sugar for:
<pre>
&amp;name1[exps]{abc&amp;[&amp;name2[exps]{klm}]xyz}
</pre>
<p>
This nesting of markup motivates using
the same escape character for both top-level and enclosed forms.

<h2>Translation to list form</h2>
<p>
As shown, the Scheme reader translates a named quasi-literal to a list,
which is then subject to regular macro-expansion and evaluation:
<pre>
&amp;tag{...}
</pre>
is read as if it were:
<pre>
($construct$:tag ...)
</pre>
One can see this mapping by quoting the form:
<pre>
'&amp;tag{...} &#x027F9; ($construct$:tag ...)
</pre>
<p>
The choice of the translation <code>$construct$:tag</code>
is somewhat arbitrary.  We want it to be easy for programmers
to write, to be readable, and thus not excessively verbose.
We want the symbol to include the actual <code>tag</code> as part of the name,
but using just <code>tag</code> by itself is likely to lead to
awkward name clashes.  (Of course it is perfectly
reasonable to implement <code>$construct$:tag</code> using
a <code>tag</code> function.)
Using colon to delimit the <code>tag</code> part seems
readable and clean.  Note there may be some complication
in a Scheme variant that uses colon as a package or
namespace separator, as for example Kawa does.  However,
the problem is easily solved (at least in Kawa) by defining
<code>$construct$</code> as a predefined namespace prefix.
<p>
When specifying this translation we have two semi-conflicting goals:
<ol>
<li>
<em>Information-preservation</em>:
The structure and important properties of the quasi-literal
surface syntax should be preserved in the list form,
so sophisticated macros have the information they need.
For example a macro may want to distingish literal content text
from a string literal in an enclosed expression.
One reason might to support <code>format</code>-specifiers.
In that case literal content text should get treated as part
of the format string, while a string literal in an enclosed expression
would be a value argument to <code>format</code> (possibly with a
default format specifier in the format string), which matters
if argument re-positioning is supported.
Another example: The XML data model distinguishes text nodes
from atomic string values: literal text would evaluate to
text nodes, while enclosed string values are atomic values.
Finally, we may want to distinguish initial arguments.
For example, one might want to enforce a rule that
keyword arguments are only allowed in initial arguments.
<li>
<em>Implementation-ease</em> (in the sense being easy to
write simple expanders):
We want it to be easy to write expanders when we don't care about
these distinctions.
It should be trivial to write a <code>$construct$:tag</code>.
It should be possible to define <code>$construct$:tag</code>
as a function, instead of a macro.
</ol>
<h3>Translating enclosed expressions</h3>
<p>
The translation uses a pair of special symbols
to mark the start and end of the enclosed expressions:
<pre>
($construct$:foo "s" $&lt;&lt;$ exp1 exp2 $&gt;&gt;$ "t")
</pre>
<p>
This translation scores highly on information-preservation.
It also scores highly on implementation-ease in the simple case
where we can just ignore which expressions are enclosed and which
are literal.  For example
if <code>$construct$:foo</code> is defined in the simplest way possible:
<pre>
(define $construct$:foo make-foo)
</pre>
then the example is equivalent to the call:
<pre>
(make-foo "s" "" exp1 exp2 "" "t")
</pre>
<p>
When you do a more complex translation, you may have to write a macro,
and dealing with <code>$&lt;&lt;$</code> and <code>$&gt;&gt;$</code>
is not completely trivial,
Still, this seems a reasonable tradeoff; we later provide
a helper macro <code>define-simple-constructor</code> to
simplify some common cases.
<p>
Note this convention lets us distinguish these cases (if you care):
<pre>
&amp;foo{_&amp;bar{b}_}
&amp;foo{_&[&amp;bar{b}]_}
</pre>
because these translate differently:
<pre>
($construct$:foo "_" ($construct:bar "b") "_")
($construct$:foo "_" $&lt;&lt;$ ($construct:bar "b") $&gt;&gt;$ "_")
</pre>
<p>
An earlier draft specified that translating an exclosed expression sequence:
<pre>
&amp;foo{s&amp;[exp1 exp2]t}
</pre>
would use a <code>$unquote$</code> macro to indicate the expressions:
<pre>
($construct$:foo "s" ($unquote$ exp1 exp2) "t")
</pre>
This scores well on information-preservation, but poorly
on implementation-ease.  This is because you can't write a default
(library) implementation of <code>$unquote$</code> as a function <em>or</em>
macro in a way that <q>splices</q> the expressions into the
<code>$construct$:foo</code> invocation.
We could implement <code>$unquote$</code> as an identity function,
if there was a separate <code>$unquote$</code> for each expression:
<pre>
($construct$:foo "s" ($unquote$ exp1) ($unquote$ exp2) "t")
</pre>
However, this does lose information about how many <code>&amp;[...]</code>-delimiters there were - which might (in rare situations) matter.
Also, we would need some convention to distinquish prefix arguments
from other enclosed expressions.

<h2>Extra text features</h2>
<p>
Because we use the same escape prefix <code class="literal">&amp;</code>
as in 
<a href="../srfi-109/srfi-109.html">SRFI-109 (extended string quasi-literals)</a> it is make sense to allow the same convenience features:
<ul>
<li>
XML-style character names (e.g. <code>&amp;lbrace;</code>);
<li>
XML-style character references (e.g. <code>&amp;#27;&amp;#x1B;</code>);
<li>
line-continuation (using <code>&amp;-</code>);
<li>
indentation handling (using <code>&amp;|</code>);
<li>
comments (using <code>&amp;#|comment|#</code>); and
<li>(optionally) format specifiers (as in <code>&amp;~,2f[balance-due]</code>).
</ul>
See the syntax specification below for details, and
see 
<a href="../srfi-109/srfi-109.html">SRFI-109</a>
for examples and motivation.

<h2>Resolving to constructor</h2>
<p>
The reader creates <code>$construct$:<var>cname</var></code> invocations,
so the application or library programmer must provide a
definition of <code>$construct$:<var>cname</var></code>.
It seems useful to provide some utilility functions or syntax
to simplify these.  As a start, this specification proposes:
<pre>
(define-simple-constructor <var>cname</var> <var>cname-maker</var> [<var>str-maker</var>])
</pre>
This has the effect that:
<pre>
&amp;<var>cname</var>[<var>init-arg</var> ...]{<var>text</var>}
</pre>
after being read as:
<pre>
($construct$:<var>cname</var> [<var>init-arg</var> ... $>>$] <var>text-arg</var> ...)
</pre>
gets evaluated as:
<pre>
(<var>cname-maker</var> <var>init-arg</var> ... (<var>str-maker</var> <var>text-arg</var> ...))
</pre>
<p>
The default for <code><var>str-maker</var></code> is <code>$string$</code>,
as specified in SRFI-109.
This combines
all the non-prefix arguments and treat them as a string quasi-literal.
That is makes it easy to implement:
<pre>
&amp;cname[init-exp ...]{abc&amp;[infix-exp1]def&amp;[infix-exp2]...xyz}
</pre>
as if it were a call to some specified <code><var>cname-maker</var></code> function thus:
<pre>
(<var>cname-maker</var> init-exp ... &amp;{abc&amp;[infix-exp1]def&amp;[infix-exp2]...xyz})
</pre>
<!--
<p>
If there is no definition of <code>$construct$:<var>tag</var></code>,
but there is a definition of (plain) <code><var>tag</var></code>,
should we allow an implemention use the latter to implement
the former?  Doing so may be difficult for some implementations,
so it maybe unwise to mandate such behavior.
We should probably wait for more experience.
-->

<h2>Read-time literals</h2>
<p>
A possible extension is to support SRFI-10 style read-time literals
in certain restricted cases,
when all the expressions are literal, and the transformers are available
to the reader.  This should probably not be the default (for consistency
and because of security concerns), but could be supported in an
implementation that has programmable read-tables.

<h2 id="delimiter-options">Discussion: Delimiter options</h2>
This specification uses <code class="literal">&amp;</code> as
marker/delimiter character.
Alternative marker characters were also considered, and this mostly-historical
section explains why we chose <code class="literal">&amp;</code>.
The discussion also considers <a href="../srfi-109/srfi-109.html">SRFI-109 (extended string quasi-literals)</a>, and refers to
the non-terminals defined in the syntax specifications
of both SRFI-108 and SRFI-109.
<p>
First let us focus on the escape character in <var><a href="#named-literal-part-def">named-literal-part</a></var> and
<var><a href="../srfi-109/srfi-109.html#string-literal-part-def">string-literal-part</a></var>.
After that we will look at characters to use to indicate the start
of a top-level <var><a href="../srfi-109/srfi-109.html#extended-string-literal-def">extended-string-literal</a></var> and
<var><a href="#extended-datum-literal-def">extended-datum-literal</a></var>.
<p><b>Different or same escape characters in literal-text?</b>
There are multiple different escape character roles:
first we have escapes in <var><a href="../srfi-109/srfi-109.html#string-literal-part-def">string-literal-part</a></var>.
Then in a <var><a href="#named-literal-part-def">named-literal-part</a></var> we have escaped
strings and characters (same as in <var>string-literal-part</var>),
plus we have nested <var><a href="#extended-datum-body-def">extended-datum-body</a></var>.
For the latter we prefer a single escape character for both uses,
to avoid a proliferation of escape characters.
Also, for consistency it seems better to use the same
escape character and syntax for string and character
escapes in both <var>string-literal-part</var>
and  <var>named-literal-part</var>.
The conclusion seems to be we should use the same escape character in all
roles (at least within a literal-part).
As to which character to use,
the most plausible choices seem to be <code class="literal">&amp;</code>,
<code class="literal">@</code>, or  <code class="literal">\</code>.
<p>
<b>Use <code>&amp;</code> as escape character:</b>
Using <code class="literal">&amp;</code> is compatible with
XML, HTML, SGML, and also "XML literals" embedded in programming
languages, including <a href="../srfi-107/srfi-107.html">SRFI-107 (XML reader syntax)</a>.
<p><b>Use <code>\</code> as escape character:</b>
Using <code class="literal">\</code> is of course
compatible with standard Scheme string literals.  Backslash has also
been used for as an escape in many languages, for string literals,
regular expressions, shells, TeX, and more.
If using <code class="literal">\</code> as an escape for
<a href="../srfi-109/srfi-109.html">SRFI-109</a> strings, it would be tempting to enhance standard
string literals with some of the same features, such as enclosed
expressions.  However, traditional C-style single-letter escapes,
such as <code class="literal">\n</code> cause a problem:
You either don't allow them in the literal-part of this specification
(in which case the latter is not a super-set of standard string escapes),
or you need some non-letter prefix character
in front of a <var class="non-terminal">cname</var>, which is tedious.
<p>
<b>Use <code>@</code> as escape character:</b>
Using <code class="literal">@</code> as the escape character
goes back to Scribe, TexInfo, and Scribble.  These are all markup
languages, not programming languages.  However, Scribble allows nested
Racket Scheme expression, and
(if you select the <code>at-exp</code> Racket parser)
you can also nest Scribble nested in a top-level Scheme program.
<p><b>Braces vs brackets:</b>
The specification uses <code>{</code>curly braces<code>}</code>
for quoted (literal) text, and uses <code>[</code>square brackes<code>]</code>
to delimit unquoted expressions.
This is <q>compatible</q> with Scribble;
<a href="http://brl.sourceforge.net/brl_toc.html">BRL</a>'s use of square
brackets; <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/about/language.html">Tcl</a>'s use
of brackets and braces.
On the other hand, <a href="http://www.javafxcookbook.com/home/working-with-strings">JavaFX Script</a> used <code>{</code>curly braces<code>}</code> for
escaped expressions.  So did Kawa's
<a href="http://per.bothner.com/blog/2010/XML-literals/">XML literals</a>.
(However Kawa XML literals can support both brackets as well
as braces as a depecated alternative.)
<p><b>Use braces only:</b>
Another option is instead of a single escape character we just use
brackets to enclose expressions, without a prefix character, as in:
<pre>
&amp;{Here is the average: [(/ sum count)].}
</pre>
Special characters can be expressed using standard Scheme character
or string literals.  It is not clear how one would handle a
nested <var class="non-terminal"><a href="#extended-datum-body-def">extended-datum-body</a></var>.
Special features, like format specifier, and line-paste escapes
are also difficult to express.
<p><b>Use implicit concatenation instead of enclosed expressions:</b>
Finally, it is possible to not have any support for expression
escapes, but instead have a more compact format for concatenation.
For example a string literal right next to an expression, with no
space in between, could be defined as concatenation.  Thus:
<pre>
"Here is the average: "(/ sum count)"."
</pre>
This is pretty fragile (in terms of unintended whitespace for example)
though using different start and end string delimiters (for example
square brackets) helps:
<pre>
{Here is the average: }(/ sum count){.}
</pre>
<p><b>Single character to start quasi-literals:</b>
Next, when it comes to the the Scheme expression level,
we need an unambiguous
character or sequence of character to mark the start of a quasi-literal.
If we use a single character, it makes sense for that character
to match the literal-part escape character,
since it easies nested <var>named-literal-part</var> forms.
<p>
Using <code class="literal">\</code> as the start character
does not appear to conflict with (draft-)R7RS, but it would be
a conflict for many Scheme implementations that use
<code class="literal">\</code> as a <q>single-escape character</q>
as in Common Lisp.
<p>
Using <code class="literal">@</code> as the start character
does not seem to conflict with standard Scheme, because
it is not a valid identifier-start character.  However, it
might conflict with implementation extensions.
(For example Kawa uses <code class="literal">@</code>
to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/Annotations.html">name
Java-style annotations</a>.)
<p>
Using <code class="literal">&amp;</code> as the start character
may cause compatibility problems, since <code class="literal">&amp;</code>
is a valid <var class="non-terminal">&lt;initial&gt;</var> character in standard Scheme, thus
it might be difficult to disambiguate from an identifier.
Some R6RS-based naming conventions use such names for
record types or exception types.
The sequence  <code class="literal">&amp;</code>
followed by a name followed by brackets or braces is effectively
non-conflicting:  In a Scheme that defines brackets as equivalent
to parentheses, the following is techically well-defined:
<pre>
&amp;name[form1 form2]
</pre>
as it could be read as two datum items:
<pre>
&amp;name (form1 form2)
</pre>
<p>
If such as Scheme were to implement this SRFI, it would change that
reading to:
<pre>
($construct$:name $&lt;&lt;$ form1 form2 $&gt;&gt;$)
</pre>
That is why this specification requires a braces-delimited
named-literal-part, even when the latter is empty.
<p>
<b>Starting quasi-literals with # and a dispatch character:</b>
Starting quasi-literals with <code class="literal">#\</code>
conflicts with character literals.
Neither <code class="literal">#&amp;</code> or
<code class="literal">#@</code> appear problematic.
However, starting a string literal such as <code>#&amp;{text}</code>
with 3 delimiter characters is rather ugly and easily mistyped.
<!--
<p><b>Recommendation:</b>
Either:
<ul>
<li><q>XML style</q>, as in <span style="border: thin solid red">red</span>
examples, and most of the write-up; or:
<li><q>Scribble style</q>, as in <span style="border: thin solid green">green</span>
examples.  However, <b>note</b> that while I call this <q>Scribble style</q>
what I recommend is only Scribble-compatible to a limited extent.
Most importantly:
<pre>
@{text}
</pre>
is (in this family of proposals) used for string quasi-literals,
and evaluates to a string.  I think this is a much more useful
result than in Scribble.
Also, quoted forms yield different results that in Scribble.
<p>
Using <code>@</code> is escape character still leaves open
when to uses braces and when to use brackets.
I would prefer to use curly braces for enclosed expressions and
square brackets for literal-parts, mainly because it is compatible
with <a href="../srfi-107/srfi-107.html">SRFI-107 (XML reader syntax)</a> as currently implemented in Kawa.
However, Scibble uses it the other way round - but
<var>extended-datum-literal</var> will be only approximately
compatible with Scribble anyway, so that shouldn't be deciding.

<!-- as <var class="non-terminal">NCName</var>;see discussion there.-->
<p>
The non-terminal <var>named-literal-part</var> is the same as <var>string-literal-part</var> in <a href="../srfi-109/srfi-109.html">SRFI-109 (extended string quasi-literals)</a>,
except for the support for a nested <var class="non-terminal">extended-datum-body</var>.
<pre>
<var class="non-terminal-def" id="named-literal-part-def">named-literal-part</var> ::=
    <i>any character except </i><code>&amp;</code><i>, </i><code>{</code> <i>or</i> <code>}</code>

  | <var class="non-terminal">extended-datum-body</var>
</pre>
<p>The remaining non-terminals match those of
<a href="../srfi-109/srfi-109.html">SRFI-109 (extended string quasi-literals)</a>.

</pre>
<p>
An <var class="non-terminal">enclosed-modifier</var> is normally empty,
but implementations may support extensions (for example format specifiers);
see discussion in <a href="../srfi-109/srfi-109.html#enclosed-modifier-def">SRFI-109</a>.
<pre>
<var class="non-terminal-def">enclosed-modifier</var> ::= <i>empty</i>
</pre>
</div>
The following are defined by R7RS: <var class="non-terminal">nested-comment</var>,
<var class="non-terminal">intraline-whitespace</var>,
<var class="non-terminal">line-ending</var>,
<var class="non-terminal">digit</var>,
and <var class="non-terminal">hex-digit</var>.

<h2>Translation</h2>
<p>The general form:
<pre>
&amp;name[exp1 ... expN]{part1...partM}
</pre>
is translated by the reader to:
<pre>
($construct$:name exp1 ... expN $&gt;&gt;$ tpart1 ... tpartM)
</pre>
More precisely:
<div>
<pre>
<b>Tr[</b><code class="literal">&amp;</code><var class="non-terminal">name</var> <code class="literal">[</code> <var class="non-terminal">expression</var>* <code class="literal">]{</code> <var class="non-terminal">initial-ignored</var>? <var class="non-terminal">content-piece</var>* <code class="literal">}</code><b>]</b>
   &#x27fe; <code class="literal">($construct$:</code><var class="non-terminal">name</var> <var class="non-terminal">expression</var>* <code class="literal">$&gt;&gt;$</code> <b>TrContent[</b>content-piece<b>]</b>* <code class="literal">)</code>
<b>Tr[</b><code class="literal">&amp;</code><var class="non-terminal">name</var> <code class="literal">{</code> <var class="non-terminal">initial-ignored</var>? <var class="non-terminal">content-piece</var>* <code class="literal">}</code><b>]</b>
   &#x27fe; <code class="literal">($construct$:</code><var class="non-terminal">name</var> <b>TrContent[</b>content-piece<b>]</b>* <code class="literal">)</code>
</pre>
<p><code><b>TrContent</b></code> is as in <a href="../srfi-109/srfi-109.html#specification-translation">SRFI-109</a>, except we add this rule:
<pre>
<b>TrContent[</b><var class="non-terminal">extended-datum-body</var><b>]</b>
  &#x27fe; <b>Tr[</b><var class="non-terminal">extended-datum-body</var><b>]</b>
</pre>
</div>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>
<pre>
(define-simple-constructor <var>cname</var> <var>cname-maker</var> [<var>str-maker</var>])
</pre>
The default for <code><var>str-maker</var></code> is <code>$string$</code>,
as specified in
<a href="../srfi-109/srfi-109.html#specification-translation">SRFI-109</a>.
This provides a syntax binding for <code>$construct$:<var>cname</var></code>
such that
<pre>
($construct$:<var>cname</var> [<var>init-arg</var> ... $>>$] <var>text-arg</var> ...)
</pre>
gets evaluated as:
<pre>
(<var>cname-maker</var> <var>init-arg</var> ... (<var>str-maker</var> <var>text-arg</var> ...))
</pre>
<p>
<code>$&lt;&lt;$</code> and <code>$&gt;&gt;$</code>
are bound to unique zero-length strings, as in SRFI-109.

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>
Since this specification changes the reader format, and there
is no standard Scheme way to do that, there is no portable implementation.
However, this specification is being implemented in
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/">Kawa</a>.
(Check out the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/Getting-Kawa.html">development version using Subversion</a>.)

<h2>Test suite</h2>
There is a
<a href="http://sourceware.org/viewvc/kawa/trunk/testsuite/srfi-108-test.scm?view=co">test suite in the Kawa source tree</a>.
