<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
This SRFI defines immutable deques. A deque is a double-ended queue, a sequence which allows elements to be added or removed efficiently from either end.  A structure is immutable when all its operations leave the structure unchanged. Note that none of the procedures specified here ends with an exclamation point.</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>
A double-ended queue, or <em>deque</em> (pronounced "deck") is a sequential data structure which allows elements to be added or removed from either end in amortized O(1) time.  It is a generalization of both a queue and a stack, and can be used as either by disregarding the irrelevant procedures.  
</p>
<p>
This SRFI describes immutable deques, or <em>ideques</em>.  Immutable structures are sometimes called <em>persistent</em> and are closely related to <em>pure functional</em> (a.k.a. <em>pure</em>) structures. The availability of immutable data structures facilitates writing efficient programs in the pure-functional style.
Immutable deques can also be seen as a bidirectional generalization of immutable lists, and some of the procedures documented below are most useful in that context.
Unlike the immutable lists of <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-116/srfi-116.html">SRFI 116</a>, it is efficient to produce modified versions of an ideque; unlike the list queues of <a class="ext-link" href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-117/srfi-117.html">SRFI 117</a>, it is possible to efficiently return an updated version of an ideque without mutating any earlier versions of it.
</p>
<p>
The specification was designed jointly by Kevin Wortman and John Cowan.  John Cowan is the editor and shepherd.  The two-list implementation was written by John Cowan.</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>
We specify required time efficiency upper bounds using big-O notation. We note when, in some cases, there is "slack" between the required bound and the theoretically optimal bound for an operation. Implementations may use data structures with amortized time bounds, but should document which bounds hold in only an amortized sense. 
</p>
<p>
Deques are disjoint from all other Scheme types.
</p>
<h2 id="Constructors">Constructors</h2>
<p>
<tt>(ideque </tt> <em>element</em> ...<tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Returns an ideque containing the <em>elements</em>. The first element (if any) will be at the front of the ideque and the last element (if any) will be at the back. Takes O(n) time, where <em>n</em> is the number of elements.
</p>
<p>
<tt>(ideque-tabulate </tt><em>n proc</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Invokes the predicate <em>proc</em> on every exact integer from 0 (inclusive) to <em>n</em> (exclusive).  Returns an ideque containing the results in order of generation.  Takes O(n) time.
</p>
<p>
<tt>(ideque-unfold </tt><em>stop? mapper successor seed</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Invokes the predicate <em>stop?</em> on <em>seed</em>.  If it returns false, generate the next result by applying <em>mapper</em> to <em>seed</em>, generate the next seed by applying <em>successor</em> to <em>seed</em>, and repeat this algorithm with the new seed.  If <em>stop?</em> returns true, return an ideque containing the results in order of accumulation.  Takes O(n) time.
</p>
<p>
<tt>(ideque-unfold-right </tt><em>stop? mapper successor seed</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Invokes the predicate <em>stop?</em> on <em>seed</em>.  If it returns false, generate the next result by applying <em>mapper</em> to <em>seed</em>, generate the next seed by applying <em>successor</em> to <em>seed</em>, and repeat the algorithm with the new seed.  If <em>stop?</em> returns true, return an ideque containing the results in reverse order of accumulation.  Takes O(n) time.
</p>
<h2 id="Predicates">Predicates</h2>
<p>
<tt>(ideque? </tt><em>x</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Returns <tt>#t</tt> if <em>x</em> is an ideque, and <tt>#f</tt> otherwise.  Takes O(1) time.
</p>
<p>
<tt>(ideque-empty? </tt><em>ideque</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Returns <tt>#t</tt> if <em>ideque</em> contains zero elements, and <tt>#f</tt> otherwise.  Takes O(1) time.
</p>
<p>
<tt>(ideque= </tt><em>elt= ideque ...</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Determines ideque equality, given an element-equality procedure. Ideque A equals ideque B if they are of the same length, and their corresponding elements are equal, as determined by <i>elt=</i>. If the element-comparison procedure's first argument is from <em>ideque<sub>i</sub></em>, then its second argument is from <em>ideque<sub>i+1</sub></em>, i.e. it is always called as <code>(</code><em>elt= a b</em><code>)</code> for <em>a</em> an element of ideque A, and <em>b</em> an element of ideque B.</p>
<p>
In the n-ary case, every <em>ideque<sub>i</sub></em> is compared to <em>ideque<sub>i+1</sub></em> (as opposed, for example, to comparing <em>ideque<sub>1</sub></em> to every <em>ideque<sub>i</sub></em>, for i > 1). If there are zero or one ideque arguments, <code>ideque=</code> simply returns true. 
The name does not end in a question mark for compatibility with the SRFI-1 procedure <code>list=</code>. 
</p>
<p>
Note that the dynamic order in which the <em>elt=</em> procedure is applied to pairs of elements is not specified. For example, if <code>ideque=</code> is applied to three ideques, A, B, and C, it may first completely compare A to B, then compare B to C, or it may compare the first elements of A and B, then the first elements of B and C, then the second elements of A and B, and so forth. 
</p>
<p>
The equality procedure must be consistent with <code>eq?</code>. 
Note that this implies that two ideques which are <code>eq?</code> are always <code>ideque=</code>, as well; implementations may exploit this fact to "short-cut" the element-by-element comparisons. 
</p>
<p>
<tt>(ideque-any </tt><em>pred ideque</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
<tt>(ideque-every </tt><em>pred ideque</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Invokes <em>pred</em> on the elements of the <em>ideque</em> in order until one call returns a true/false value, which is then returned.  If there are no elements, returns <tt>#f</tt>/<tt>#t</tt>.  Takes O(n) time.

<p>
<tt>(ideque-ref </tt><em>ideque n</em><tt>)</tt>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Returns two values, the results of <tt>(ideque-take </tt><em>ideque n</em><tt>)</tt> and <tt>(ideque-drop </tt><em>ideque n</em><tt>)</tt> respectively, but may be more efficient.  Takes O(n) time.
</p>
<h2 id="Thewholedeque">The whole ideque</h2>
<p>
<tt>(ideque-length </tt><em>ideque</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Returns the length of <em>ideque</em> as an exact integer.  May take O(n) time, though O(1) is optimal.
</p>
<p>
<tt>(ideque-append </tt><em>ideque</em> ...<tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Returns an ideque with the contents of the <em>ideque</em> followed by the others, or an empty ideque if there are none. Takes O(kn) time, where k is the number of ideques and n is the number of elements involved, though O(k log n) is possible.
</p>
<p>
<tt>(ideque-reverse </tt><em>ideque</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<em>Pred</em> is a procedure taking a single value and returning a single value. It is applied element-wise to the elements of <var>ideque</var>, and a count is tallied of the number of elements that produce a true value. This count is returned.  Takes O(n) time.

Terminates when all the elements of any of the ideques have been processed. Takes O(kn) time, where <em>k</em> is the number of ideques and <em>n</em> is the number of elements in the shortest ideque.

</p>
<p>
<tt>(ideque-fold-right </tt><em>proc nil ideque</em><tt>)</tt>

<p>
<tt>(list-&gt;ideque </tt><em>list</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
<tt>(ideque-&gt;list </tt><em>ideque</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Conversion between ideque and list structures. FIFO order is preserved, so the front of a list corresponds to the front of an ideque. Each operation takes O(n) time.
</p>
<p>
<tt>(generator-&gt;ideque </tt><em>generator</em><tt>)</tt>
</p>
<p>

Conversion between
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-121/srfi-121.html">SRFI 121</a>
generators and ideques.  Each operation takes O(n) time.  A generator
is a procedure that is called repeatedly with no arguments to generate
consecutive values, and returns an end-of-file object when it has no
more values to return.
</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>The sample implementation is in the in the <code>ideque-2list</code> subdirectory of the repository for
this SRFI.  It is an implementation based on two Scheme lists, one
for the front and another (in reverse element order) for the back.
The cost of <code>ideque-front</code>, <code>ideque-back</code>,
<code>ideque-remove-front</code>, and <code>ideque-remove-back</code>
are amortized O(1).  An implementation based on finger trees may be
added later.</p>
