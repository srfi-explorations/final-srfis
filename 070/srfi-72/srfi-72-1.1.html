<h1>Abstract</h1>



This SRFI describes a procedural macro proposal for Scheme with the following
features:

<ul>
<li>
 <h3>Improved hygiene:</h3>
 <p>
  Existing hygienic macro systems work well for high-level macros, but tend to
  run into 
  unintended variable capture problems with procedural macros.
  The proposal described here addresses a class of unintended
  capture problems that may occur in procedural macros. 
</li>
<p>
<li>
 <h3>Improved hygiene breaking:</h3>
 <p>
   A primitive is provided for writing hygiene-breaking macros
   that are composable and referentially transparent, correcting
   a known shortcoming of some existing macro systems.  
</li>
<p>
<li>
 <h3>Simplicity:</h3>
 <p>
   The design provides a small number of primitives with simple semantics. 
More complex features, including pattern matching facilities and
     syntax-case, may be built on top of the current design and are available as libraries.  
</li>
<p>
<li>
 <h3><tt>SYNTAX-RULES</tt> and <tt>SYNTAX-CASE:</tt></h3>
 <p>
Both <tt>syntax-rules</tt> and <tt>syntax-case</tt> have been implemented as macros in the system described here
and are available as libraries.  In particular, one obtains a 
concise and portable implementation and
semantics for <tt>syntax-case</tt> in terms of a simpler macro system.
</li> 
<p>
<li>
 <h3>Fast hygiene algorithm:</h3>
 <p>
   The reference implementation documents 
   an imperative hygiene algorithm that is eager, 
   has linear complexity, and is very fast.
</li>
<p>
<li>
 <h3>Source-object correlation:</h3>
 <p>
   Source correlation information is not associated with syntax 
   objects, but instead instead recorded separately during expansion.  
   All intermediate expansion steps from the source to the object code
   are made available. 
</li>
<p>
<li>
 <h3>Tractable implementation:</h3>
 <p>
   The implementation is small and tractable, written in mostly portable 
   R5RS Scheme without using R5RS macros.  It should run out of the box on 
   most existing Schemes. 
</li>
</ul>


<a name="intro"></a>
<h1>Introduction</h1>

We start with a simple example:

<pre>
   (define-syntax (swap! a b)
     (quasisyntax
       (let ((temp ,a)) 
         (set! ,a ,b) 
         (set! ,b temp))))
</pre>

This macro builds a syntax object using the <tt>quasisyntax</tt> primitive.
Identifiers appearing in the quoted part of the quasisyntax
expression are hygienically introduced.  Syntax provided as part 
of the input expression is inserted in the result using <tt>unquote</tt> 
or <tt>unquote-splicing</tt>.  

<p>
To test hygiene, we may evaluate:

<pre>   
   (let ((temp 1)
         (set! 2))
     (swap! set! temp)
     (values temp set!))   ;==&gt; 2 1
</pre>

The above macro may also be written as

<pre>
   (define-syntax swap!
     (lambda form
       (let ((a (cadr  form))
             (b (caddr form)))
         (quasisyntax
           (let ((temp ,a)) 
             (set! ,a ,b) 
             (set! ,b temp))))))
</pre>
This illustrates that syntax objects are s-expressions manipulable
with the usual Scheme primitives.  Instead of symbols,
these s-expressions contain identifiers, which belong to a separate
data type.  

<p>
For comparing identifiers, the primitives <tt>free-identifier=?</tt>, 
<tt>bound-identifier=?</tt>
and <tt>literal-identifier=?</tt>, familiar from <tt>syntax-case</tt> 
[6, 7], are provided.
For example, a simplified <tt>cond</tt> macro can be written as follows: 


<pre>
  (define-syntax (my-cond clause . clauses)
    (if (and (list? clause) (>= (length clause) 2))
        (cond ((literal-identifier=? (car clause) 
                                     (syntax else)) (quasisyntax (begin ,@(cdr clause))))
              ((null? clauses)                      (quasisyntax (if ,(car clause) (begin ,@(cdr clause)))))
              (else                                 (quasisyntax (if ,(car clause)
                                                                     (begin ,@(cdr clause))
                                                                     (my-cond ,@clauses)))))
        (syntax-error)))
           
  (my-cond (#f 1) (else 2))                ==> 2
  (let ((else #f)) (my-cond (else 2)))     ==> unspecified
</pre>

This concludes the lightning overview of the core proposal.  

<p>
We mention that, while not part of the core design, a pattern matcher is 
available separately as a library, allowing the above macro to be written as:
  
<pre>
  (define-syntax my-cond
    (lambda form
      (match form
        ((_ ((syntax else) e1 e2 ...)) (quasisyntax (begin ,e1 ,,e2 ...)))
        ((_ (e0 e1 e2 ...))            (quasisyntax (if ,e0 (begin ,e1 ,,e2 ...))))
        ((_ (e0 e1 e2 ...) c1 c2 ...)  (quasisyntax (if ,e0
					                (begin ,e1 ,,e2 ...)
                                                        (my-cond ,c1 ,,c2 ...))))
        (_ (syntax-error)))))
</pre>

Finally, both <tt>syntax-rules</tt> and <tt>syntax-case</tt> can be implemented
as macros in the system described here and are available as 
libraries, so that we can write, for example.  

<pre>
  (define-syntax my-cond
    (lambda form
      (syntax-case form (else)
        ((_ (else e1 e2 ...))         (syntax (begin e1 e2 ...)))
        ((_ (e0 e1 e2 ...))           (syntax (if e0 (begin e1 e2 ...))))
        ((_ (e0 e1 e2 ...) c1 c2 ...) (syntax (if e0
                                                  (begin e1 e2 ...)
                                                  (my-cond c1 c2 ...)))))))
</pre>

These extensions are described at [1].


<a name="hygiene"></a><h1>Improved Hygiene</h1>

The semantics of the predicate <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt> is
similar to its counterpart in the <tt>syntax-case</tt>
system, and is described in the specification section below.

<p>
Our design differs from the <tt>syntax-case</tt> system in
the way in which
<tt>bound-identifier=?</tt> identifiers are introduced.  
Each evaluation of a <tt>quasisyntax</tt> expression occurs in a fresh 
hygienic context, so that identifiers 
introduced during separate evaluations of <tt>quasisyntax</tt> expressions are 
never <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt>, even if these occur during the same 
macro invocation.

<pre>
  (bound-identifier=? (quasisyntax x) (quasisyntax x))   ==&gt; #f
</pre>

This choice, inspired by [3, 4], makes it easier to avoid a class of unintentional variable capture problems that
may occur in procedural macros, an issue that had been largely neglected in 
most existing designs. 

<p>  
To see the problem, consider converting the helper macro in the following

<pre>
  (define-syntax no-capture
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((no-capture) (let ((temp 1)) (helper temp)))))

  (define-syntax helper
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((helper value) (let ((temp 2)) value))))

  (no-capture)    ==&gt; 1
</pre>

to a procedure.  The naive <tt>syntax-case</tt> implementation 

<pre>
 (define-syntax (capture stx)

   (define (helper value)
     (with-syntax ((value value)) 
       (syntax (let ((temp 2)) value))))

   (syntax-case stx ()
     ((capture)
      (with-syntax ((nested (helper (syntax temp))))
        (syntax (let ((temp 1))
                  nested))))))

  (capture)    ==&gt; 2
</pre>

gives the wrong answer.
The binding for <tt>temp</tt> introduced by 
<tt>helper</tt> has captured the <tt>temp</tt> introduced in the syntax-case body, 
which was not our intent.  

<p>                                       
In the system proposed here, the above macro is expressed as follows:

<pre>
  (define-syntax (no-more-capture)

    (define (helper value)
      (quasisyntax 
        (let ((temp 2)) ,value)))

    (let ((temp (quasisyntax temp)))
      (quasisyntax 
        (let ((,temp 1))
          ,(helper temp)))))

  (no-more-capture)            ==&gt; 1
</pre>
Since each <tt>quasisyntax</tt> evaluation occurs in a new hygienic 
context, the two identifiers <tt>temp</tt> are distinct in the 
sense of <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt>.  As a result, no accidental 
capture will take place, and we get the correct answer.  

<p>    
The unintentional capture problem becomes particularly insidious when code is generated recursively. 
Consider the following reasonable-looking <tt>syntax-case</tt> implementation of 
a <tt>let</tt> macro with guaranteed left to right evaluation:

<pre>
  (define-syntax let-ordered
    (lambda (form)
      
      (define (let-help form temps vars)
        (syntax-case form ()
          ((_ () . body)
           (with-syntax (((var ...) vars)
                         ((temp ...) temps))
             (syntax
              (let ((var temp) ...) . body))))      
          ((_ ((var exp) binding ...) . body)
           (with-syntax ((rest (let-help (syntax (_ (binding ...) . body))
                                         (cons (syntax temp) temps)
                                         (cons (syntax var) vars))))
             (syntax (let ((temp exp))
                       rest))))))
      
      (let-help form '() '())))

  (let-ordered ((x 1)
                (y 2))
    (+ x y))               ==> 4    
</pre>

The error occurs because all the identifiers <tt>temp</tt>, occurring in nested
bindings, are <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt>, so that an unintended variable capture
occurs.  Note that, because of hygiene, this problem would not 
have occurred  if <tt>let-helper</tt> had been implemented as a macro instead of 
a helper procedure. 
<p>

In the MzScheme <tt>syntax-case</tt> extension, primitives <tt>make-syntax-introducer</tt> and 
<tt>syntax-local-introduce</tt> may be inserted in the appropriate places 
to obtain the correct behaviour in the 
above macros.  However, correct usage of these primitives is nontrivial, and 
requires the programmer to 
be aware that the problem occurs in the first place.   
The default behaviour remains unsafe.
 
<p>
We see that, in these macro systems, the programmer has to keep track of the names of 
all identifiers introduced in the macro and
all its helper procedures.  This may be nontrivial if the macro is 
large or has various helpers, and is reminiscent of the difficulties
one encounters in languages with dynamic scoping of variables.
Avoiding name clashes is not enough, as the <tt>let-ordered</tt>
macro shows.   In general, it may be quite hard to verify
whether accidental 
captures occur if code is generated recursively.  

<p>
This issue clearly violates the spirit of lexical scoping and hygiene. 
It breaks the modularity and constrains the maintainability
of complex macros such as pattern matchers.  
                         
<p>
With the proposal of this SRFI, the above macro can be expressed as follows:


<pre>
  (define-syntax (let-ordered bindings . body)

    (define (let-help bindings temps variables)
      (cond ((null? bindings) (quasisyntax
                                (let ,(map list variables temps) ,@body)))
            ((pair? bindings) (let ((temp (quasisyntax temp)))
                                (quasisyntax
                                  (let ((,temp ,(cadar bindings)))
                                    ,(let-help (cdr bindings)
                                               (cons temp temps)
                                               (cons (caar bindings) variables))))))))

    (let-help bindings '() '()))
                                               

  (let-ordered ((x 1)
                (y 2))
    (+ x y))              ==> 3
</pre>

We obtain the correct result, despite having used the same name
for the distinct temporaries, since each <tt>quasisyntax</tt> evaluation occurs
in its own hygienic context.  

<p>
Notice that <tt>quasisyntax</tt> allows the following implementation of generate-temporaries:
<pre>
  (define (generate-temporaries lst)
    (map (lambda (_) (quasisyntax temp))
         lst))
</pre>

To support macro-generating macros correctly, we have to keep the traditional
semantics for <tt>syntax</tt>.  All 
<tt>syntax</tt> evaluations occurring during a single macro invocation
occur in the same hygienic context:
<pre>
  (bound-identifier=? (syntax x) (syntax x))     ==&gt; #t
</pre>
We may then use the traditional Lisp techniques for 
splicing syntax into a generated macro, with <tt>quasisyntax</tt> 
in place of <tt>quasiquote</tt> and <tt>syntax</tt> in place of <tt>quote</tt>:
<pre>
  (define-syntax (macro-generate name id)
    (quasisyntax 
      (define-syntax (,name)
        (quasisyntax (let ((,(syntax ,id) 4)) ,(syntax ,id))))))

  (macro-generate test z)
  
  (test)   ==&gt; 4
</pre>

As a bonus, this semantics makes it possible to define <tt>syntax-case</tt>
as a macro in our system.  
We point out, though, that careless use of <tt>syntax</tt>  
can lead to exactly the capture problems decribed above.
Indeed, if we had instead written <pre>  (let ((temp (syntax temp))) ...</pre>
in <tt>let-help</tt>, the macro would be wrong.  
This problem can be avoided by programmer discipline,
restricting the use of <tt>syntax</tt> to the kind of essential
splicing situations that occur in macro-generating macros.  




<a name="breaking"></a><h1>Improved hygiene breaking</h1>

We would like to write an unhygienic macro <tt>if-it</tt> that assigns
the value of its condition to the identifier <tt>it</tt> in its consequent 
and alternative.

<pre>
  (if-it 1 it 42)      ==&gt; 1
</pre>

We would also like to be able to compose unhygienic macros.  
In particular, we would like to be able to write macros <tt>when-it</tt>, 
<tt>if-flag-it</tt> and <tt>my-or</tt> in terms of <tt>if-it</tt> as follows:

<pre>
  (define-syntax (when-it condition consequent)
    (quasisyntax 
      (if-it ,condition
             ,consequent
             (if #f #f))))

  (define-syntax (if-flag-it body else)
    (quasisyntax 
      (if-it flag ,body ,else)))

  (define-syntax (my-or expr1 expr2)
    (quasisyntax 
      (if-it ,expr1 it ,expr2)))
</pre>

We impose the following requirements on the semantics:
   
<pre>
  (when-it 42 it)                ==&gt; 42
 
  (define flag 3)
  (if-flag-it it 'none)          ==&gt; 3

  (my-or 2  it)                  ==&gt; 2
  (my-or #f it)                  ==&gt; #f
</pre>

The macro system described here has a primitive <tt>datum->syntax</tt>
similar to that provided by <tt>syntax-case</tt>.  However, 
as far as the author is aware, it is impossible to satisfy these four 
conditions using <tt>datum-&gt;syntax</tt> without code-walking.  
Furthermore, we wish to impose the 
following referential transparency conditions

<pre>
  (let ((it 1)) (if-it 42 it #f))   ==&gt; 1
  (let ((it 1)) (when-it 42 it))    ==&gt; 1
  (let ((it 1)) (my-or 2 it))       ==&gt; 2 (note)
  (let ((it 1)) (my-or #f it))      ==&gt; 1  
</pre>

by analogy with the behaviour of 

<pre>
  (let ((else #f)) (my-cond (else 2)))    ==&gt; unspecified
</pre>

To satisfy these requirements, we provide a new primitive, 
<tt>make-capturing-identifier</tt>, that introduces an identifier which, when 
bound, will capture all <tt>free-identifier=?</tt> identifiers in its scope.  
With this primitive, the following implementation of <tt>if-it</tt> satisfies 
all the above requirements:

<pre>
  (define-syntax (if-it condition consequent alternative)
    (let ((it (make-capturing-identifier (syntax here) 'it)))
      (quasisyntax 
        (let ((,it ,condition)) 
          (if ,it
              ,consequent 
              ,alternative)))))
</pre>

A similar idea has been proposed by Oleg Kiselyov in [2].
<p>
The denotation of the new identifier is determined by the syntactic
environment of the first argument.  This allows us fine control
over what we mean by referential transparency.  Compare for example the 
above with:

<pre>
  (define-syntax if-it 
    (lambda (_ condition consequent alternative)
      (let ((it (make-capturing-identifier _ 'it)))
        (quasisyntax
          (let ((,it ,condition)) 
            (if ,it
                ,consequent 
                ,alternative))))))

  (let ((it 1)) (if-it 42 it #f))   ==&gt; 42
</pre>

<p>
The primitive <tt>datum-&gt;syntax</tt> is still the
appropriate primitive for introducing identifiers that should be captured 
by <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt> identifiers in surrounding binding forms.
Comparing with the description of <tt>make-capturing-identifier</tt> above,
we see that the one introduces identifiers that are the <i>subject</i> of capture,
while the other introduces identifiers that should be the <i>object</i> of capture.  

<a name="correlation"></a><h1>
Source-object correlation:
</h1>

In the reference implementation,
 invoking <tt>syntax-error</tt> will display all the expansion
steps starting from the source expression.  The same information may
be made available to runtime debugging tools if required.



<a name="spec"></a>
<h1>Specification</h1>

The following macros and procedures are provided:

<pre><b>
         define-syntax
         let-syntax
         letrec-syntax
         set-syntax!

         syntax-error 
</b>
</pre>
<dl>

<dt><pre><b>Syntax objects:</b></pre>

<dd>A syntax object is an s-expression whose leaves
                are constants or identifiers.  The following expressions
                evaluate to syntax objects:
<pre>
  '()
  1
  #f
  '(1 2 3)
  (cons (syntax x) (vector 1 2 3 (syntax y)))
  (syntax (let ((x 1)) x))
  (quasisyntax (let ((x 1)) ,(syntax x)))
  </pre>
Symbols may not appear in syntax objects:
  <pre>
  '(let ((x 1)) x)  ==&gt; not a syntax object
  </pre>


<dt><pre><b>syntax: (DEFINE-SYNTAX var exp)
        (DEFINE-SYNTAX (var . formals) exp1 exp ...)</b></pre>

<dd>        <tt>Exp</tt> is expanded and then evaluated in the current top level 
        environment, <tt>var</tt> is bound to a top level location, and the 
        resulting value is stored in the location.
<p>
        The second variant is equivalent to 
<pre>
  (DEFINE-SYNTAX var (lambda (dummy . formals) exp1 exp ...)).
</pre>

        <tt>Exp</tt> may evaluate to a procedure, also called a transformer.  
        When the expander encounters a macro invocation, the corresponding
        transformer is invoked on the input form as follows:
<pre>
               (apply transformer input-form)

</pre>

<dt>
<pre><b>syntax: (SYNTAX template)</b>
</pre>
<dd>        Constructs a new syntax object from the template, which 
           must be an s-expression
        with either identifiers or constants as leaves,
        by transforming the leaves as follows:  
        Constants are unaffected, while
        identifiers are replaced by fresh identifiers
     that occur nowhere else in the program.   
These fresh identifiers are bound to the denotations of the 
original identifiers in the syntactic environment in which the template occurred. 
This means that a fresh identifier will denote the same thing as the original 
identifier in the template unless the macro application 
places an occurrence of it in a binding position [8].
<p>
        During the course of a single macro invocation, <tt>syntax</tt> acts 
        like a one-to-one mathematical function on identifiers: Two identifiers introduced via <tt>syntax</tt> expressions will be 
        <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt> if and only if the <tt>syntax</tt> expressions were evaluated during 
        the same macro invocation and the original identifiers in the templates 
        were <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt>.  

<p>
Identifiers that are <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt> are required to have the same 
denotation.  Any attempt to break this invariant should cause an error to be 
signaled. 

<pre>
  (cons (syntax x) 
        (let ((x 1)) (syntax x)))      ==> error
</pre>


    <tt>Syntax</tt> differs from the identically named form in the <tt>syntax-case</tt> 
    system in that here we have no concept of pattern variable substitution.
    Instead, existing syntax objects can be inserted in new syntax objects using
    <tt>quasisyntax</tt> with <tt>unquote</tt> or 
    <tt>unquote-splicing</tt>, using <tt>cons</tt>, <tt>list</tt>,
    <tt>vector</tt>, <tt>...</tt>  

    <p>
    <tt>Syntax-case</tt> can be implemented
    as a macro on top of the current system and is available as a library.

<p>
<b>Examples:</b>

<pre>
  (bound-identifier=? (syntax x) (syntax x))   ==&gt; #t

  (define-syntax (test)
    (quasisyntax 
      (let ((,(syntax x) 1)) ,(syntax x))))

  (test)    ==&gt; 1
</pre>

In the following example, <tt>(m)</tt> expands to <tt>(syntax x)</tt>, where 
<tt>x</tt> denotes the outer binding.  Although the expanded
<tt>(syntax x)</tt> occurs in the syntactic environment of the middle binding, 
the fresh identifier resulting from evaluating it will denote the same thing as the 
identifier <tt>x</tt> in the template.  It will therefore also refer to the outer binding.

<pre>
  (let ((x 'outer))
    (let-syntax ((m (lambda (_) (syntax (syntax x)))))
      (let ((x 'middle))
        (let-syntax ((n (lambda (_) (m))))
          (let ((x 'inner))
            (n))))))               ==&gt; outer
</pre>


The fact that <tt>syntax</tt> preserves <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt> equivalence
during the course of the macro invocation is useful for 
writing macro-generating macros using the traditional Lisp techniques for 
splicing syntax into a generated macro (with quasisyntax instead of
quasiquote and syntax in place of quote):   

<pre>
  (define-syntax (macro-generate name id)
    (quasisyntax 
      (define-syntax (,name)
        (quasisyntax 
          (let ((,(syntax ,id) 4)) ,(syntax ,id))))))

  (macro-generate test z)
  
  (test)   ==&gt; 4
</pre>


  Note that <tt>syntax</tt> does not unify identifiers previously distinct in the sense
  of <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt> occurring 
  in <tt>template</tt> even if they
  have the same symbolic name:

<pre>  (let ((x 1))
    (let-syntax ((m (lambda (_) (syntax (syntax x)))))
      (let ((x 2))
        (let-syntax ((n (lambda (_)
                          (quasisyntax
                           (let-syntax ((o (lambda (_)
                                             (,(syntax syntax)
                                               (,(syntax list) 
                                                 ,(m)
                                                 ,(syntax x))))))
                             (o))))))
          (n)))))                                ==&gt; (1 2)

</pre>



  

<dt>
<pre><b>syntax: (QUASISYNTAX template)</b>
</pre>
<dd>        
Constructs a new syntax object from the template, which 
           must be an s-expression
        with either identifiers or constants as leaves, and where parts 
        of the expression may be unquoted
using <tt>unquote</tt> or <tt>unquote-splicing</tt>. 
<p>
        As in the case of <tt>syntax</tt>, identifiers appearing in the quoted part of 
        the template are replaced by fresh identifiers 
bound to the denotations of the 
original identifiers in the syntactic environment in which the template occurred. 
<p>
        However, <tt>quasisyntax</tt> differs from <tt>syntax</tt> in that two identifiers 
        introduced by <tt>quasisyntax</tt> will be <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt> only if
        they are introduced during the same <i>evaluation</i> of 
        a <tt>quasisyntax</tt> expression, and the original identifiers in the 
        template were <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt>.
<p>
        Similarly to quasiquote, values may be inserted into the template 
        using <tt>unquote</tt> and <tt>unquote-splicing</tt>.  To make nested splicing 
        behave in a more useful way, the R5RS-compatible extension
        described in appendix B of Bawden's paper [10] is recommended.

<dd>        
        Identifiers are <tt>free-identifier=?</tt> if they refer to the same lexical or

        Identifiers are <tt>literal-identifier=?</tt> if they are <tt>free-identifier=?</tt> or

        This primitive should be used to reliably identify literals 
        (such as <tt>else</tt> in <tt>cond</tt>) even if they occur in a different module 
        from the macro definition.  
<p>
        Identifiers are <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt> if a binding of one would capture 
        references to the other in the scope of the binding.  Two identifiers

        expression in the original program, if they were introduced by <tt>syntax</tt> 
        during the same macro-invocation, or if they were introduced during a 
        single evaluation of a <tt>quasisyntax</tt> expression.  In addition, 
        <tt>datum-&gt;syntax</tt> may create identifiers that are <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt> 
        to previously introduced identifiers.

        These procedures return #f if either argument is not an identifier.

        introduced.  If the resulting 
        identifier occurs in a binding, it will capture any identifiers 
        in the scope of the binding that are <tt>free-identifier=?</tt> to it. 
        The new identifier is not <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt> to any

<a name="implementation"></a><h1>Implementation</h1>

The implementation uses the forms and procedures specified in R5RS.  
It does not require R5RS macros or any other existing macro system.  
In addition, it uses <tt>gensym</tt> with an optional string prefix
argument, and an interaction-environment, no-argument variant of 
<tt>eval</tt>.  It should run unmodified on systems that provide 
these additional procedures.  These include Chez, Chicken and MzScheme.    

<p>
Portability hooks are provided for Schemes that lack either
of these additional primitives.  For example, to run the code on 
Gambit, unquote the definition of <tt>gensym</tt> provided.

<p>
The implementation was strongly influenced by the explicit renaming 
system [8, 11].

<p>
We use an imperative hygiene algorithm that is eager, has linear complexity, and is
very fast.
This is achieved by having <tt>bound-identifier=?</tt>
identifiers share a location, so that alpha substitutions can be done by a
simple imperative update of an identifier and no 
additional work is required to propagate substitutions or environments to leaves.
In addition, source-object correlation information is not stored in 
syntax objects, but tracked independently, which makes it possible 
to represent syntax objects as ordinary s-expressions.    



<p>
During the draft period, the reference implementation will be available 
<a href=http://www.het.brown.edu/people/andre/macros/index.htm>here</a>.
