<h1>Abstract</h1>

This SRFI proposes text to replace section 6.2 "Numbers" of R5RS in
order to extend its capabilities, correct errors in its specification,
make it more explicit about limitations of precision and magnitude,
and improve portability between implementations.  More specifically,
this new text:

<ul>

 <li> incorporates an inexact real positive infinity and an inexact
      real negative infinity,

 </li><li> extends number syntax to incorporate inexact real
      infinities,

 </li><li> adapts Common-Lisp semantics for <samp>`expt'</samp> and
      extends them to include inexact real infinities,

 </li><li> corrects the description of <samp>`sqrt'</samp>,

 </li><li> sharpens the distinction between exact and inexact numbers,

 </li><li> removes a contradiction related to exactness,

 </li><li> extends <samp>`gcd'</samp> and <samp>`lcm'</samp> to exact
      rational numbers,

 </li><li> extends <samp>`quotient'</samp>, <samp>`modulo'</samp>, and
      <samp>`remainder'</samp> to finite real numbers,

 </li><li> clarifies the behavior of <samp>`inexact-&gt;exact'</samp>
      applied to an exact argument,

 </li><li> clarifies the behavior of <samp>`exact-&gt;inexact'</samp>
      applied to an inexact argument,

 </li><li> adds convenience procedures <samp>`exact-round'</samp>,
      <samp>`exact-ceiling'</samp>, <samp>`exact-floor'</samp>, and
      <samp>`exact-truncate'</samp>,

 </li><li> and adds examples.

</li></ul>


<h1>Rationale</h1>

The Scheme report is undergoing revision.  Changes to Scheme numerics
potentially affect over 50 procedures.  The changes to incorporate
infinities modify the descriptions of or add examples to most of the
numeric procedures.  The proposed semantics for <samp>`expt'</samp>
and exactness interract strongly with the infinity changes.
<p>
Rather than create several SRFI documents which labor over semantics
with and without the other numerical SRFI proposals, SRFI-70 proposes
them together.

<h3>Infinities</h3>

The most far-reaching change proposed is to incorporate one positive
and one negative real infinity, like those defined by the "IEEE 754:
Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic", to inexact number
systems.  The behaviors of most mathematical functions when passed an
infinity are described or demonstrated through examples.
<p>

Checks for division by zero (and their absence) are one of the most
common programming errors.  In numerical code, the conscientious
programmer must deeply nest conditionals to assure that checks for
zero precede each division.
<p>
With infinities incorporated into the number system, division by zero
returns an infinity rather than signaling an error.  It lets
initialization of variables precede bounds checks and gives
flexibility in placement of those checks.
<p>
Floating-point overflow is more difficult to check for; programs often
have vulnerabilities to numeric inputs in certain ranges.  Because the
overflow can occur in multiple places in mathematical expressions,
fixing the program to run test cases which previously produced
overflow errors does not guarantee that overflow from every possible
input will be handled.
<p>
In an implementation supporting infinities, infinities propagate
upward through most mathematical expressions.  Complete input coverage
can be achieved with checks at fewer points in the program than would
be needed without infinities.
<p>
At least nine implementations of Scheme incorporate IEEE-754
infinities.  Porting those implementations should be easy.  Programs
written without recourse to infinities are compatible with
implementations having them; but programs using infinities will be
incompatible with implementations lacking them.  Thus incorporation of
inexact infinities into R6RS improves portability of code written to
use infinities.
<p>

<!-- This SRFI attempts to strike a balance between tolerance and signaling -->
<!-- of range errors.  Having +inf.0 and -inf.0 allows one level of -->
<!-- calculation to be executed before bounds checking.  Subsequent -->
<!-- numerical calculations on infinities can report a violation of an -->
<!-- implementation restriction or return a numerical error-object (0/0). -->
<!-- <p> -->
<!-- This SRFI mandates the real infinities for implementations with -->
<!-- inexacts, but leaves to the implementations the decision of whether to -->
<!-- implement 0/0 or not.  If an implementation chooses to not support -->
<!-- 0/0, then each instance where it would be returned is an error. -->

</dt><dd>No; (mathematical) rational numbers have non-zero denominators.

<p>
</p></dd><dt>Are real infinities integers?

</dt><dd>Because they are not rational they cannot be integers.

<p>
</p></dd><dt>What about complex (non-real) infinities?

</dt><dd>Infinities in rectangular notation leads to strange beasts like
-inf.0+5i.  I know of no mathematical system having such numbers.  Polar

finite angle.  Multiplication and division of complex infinities would
work, but at the price of forcing their representations to be polar.

Chongkai Zhu points out that -inf.0 cannot be encoded by polar notation
unless pi is a number in the implementation.

<h3>Infinity Notation</h3>

There are many possibilities for inexact infinity notations:

<table cellpadding=4 BORDER=1>
<tr><th><th>positive<br>infinity<th>negative<br>infinity<th>Scheme<br>implementations
<tr><th>A<td><code>+#.#</code><td><code>-#.#</code><td>Scm 5d7, Guile 1.3.4, Bigloo 2.5c

<tr><th>L<td><code>+inf.0</code><td><code>-inf.0</code><td>Mz Scheme 202, Chez, Larceny
<tr><th>M<td><code>#i+inf</code><td><code>#i-inf</code><td>
</table>
<p>

The unsigned notation of <b>J</b> does not meet the stipulations of
R5RS section 2.1 "Identifiers":

<blockquote>
... in all implementations a sequence of letters, digits, and
"extended alphabetic characters" that begins with a character that
cannot begin a number is an identifier.
</blockquote>

Notations <b>K</b> and <b>L</b> use <samp>`.'</samp> to indicate the
inexactness of infinities.  The trailing <samp>`0'</samp> of <b>L</b>
seems superfluous, but mzscheme will not accept infinity literals
without it.  In mathematical parlance, "inf" stands for
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum"><dfn>infimum</dfn></A>,
the greatest lower bound.  These notations require extensions to R5RS
number syntax.
<p>

Notations <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, and <b>I</b> can be read in
some implementations without modifying the Scheme reader.  Of course
in those implementations, the <samp>`1'</samp> can be replaced by any
positive integer.
<P>
As Paul Schlie points out, negative infinity is just as reasonable a
result of 1/0 as is positive infinity.  So for output, notations
<b>F</b> and <b>I</b> should be used in preference to <b>E</b> and
<b>H</b> because the <samp>`+'</samp> emphasizes the sign of the
positive infinity.  Notations <b>B</b> and <b>D</b> eliminate the
<samp>`1'</samp> for positive and negative infinities, further
emphasizing the sign of the infinity.
<p>

Notation <b>G</b> uses a trailing <samp>`.'</samp> to indicate
inexactness as <b>K</b> does.  This requires a small extension to R5RS
number syntax, as rational notation (<samp>`1/0'</samp>) does not
currently allow a trailing period.  Notations <b>G</b> and <b>K</b>
are awkward when the last word in a sentence.
<p>

<A HREF="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-73"><CITE>SRFI 73: Exact Infinities</CITE></A>
uses notation <b>E</b> with a <samp>`#e'</samp> prefix.  So notations
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, and <b>B</b> should probably be not be used for
inexact infinities to avoid confusion with SRFI-73.
<p>

Someone unfamiliar with R5RS when encountering notation <b>D</b> might
guess that <samp>`#i'</samp> signifies an infinity.  This is an
improvement over notation <b>I</b>, which might be mistaken for a
complex number.
<p>

<b>J</b> and <b>K</b> lumped with <b>L</b> can be considered to have a
plurality among implementations incorporating infinities; so SRFI-70
specifies <b>L</b>.  Standardizing the notation for infinities
increases portability among implementations.


<h3>Exactness</h3>

That the programmer is responsible to avoid using numbers with
magnitude too large to be represented in an implementation is
reasonably assumed.  All implementations have size limitations, either
deliberate or due to their platform's having finite storage.
<p>
But what about numbers whose precision is too large to be represented?
R5RS is unclear about this.  Such an important property of number
systems should be explicit.  This SRFI assigns that responsibility for
exact numbers to the programmer:

<blockquote>
  Each exact number corresponds to a single mathematical number.  It
  is the programmer's responsibility to avoid using exact numbers with
  magnitude or precision too large to be represented in the
  implementation.
</blockquote>

Operations which would return too precise exact numbers can either
return an inexact number (assuming the range of inexacts is
sufficient) or report a violation of an implementation restriction.
<!-- <p> -->
<!-- Note that the iterative series often used in floating-point -->
<!-- calculations cannot be summarily converted to work on exact numbers -->
<!-- without the danger of exceeding the implementation's precision limit. -->

<h3>Inexactness</h3>

In this SRFI, the definition of inexact numbers is strengthened by
their not being subject to the caution about "precision too large to
be represented in the implementation".  Only magnitudes too large are
cautioned: <!-- , and only for the non-real case: -->

<blockquote>
  For inexact numbers, it is the programmer's responsibility to avoid
  using complex numbers with magnitude too large to be represented in
  the implementation.
</blockquote>

With this distinction between exact and inexact numbers, the last
sentence of section <a href="#6.2.1">6.2.1 Numerical types</a>, which
seems to imply that each internal number representation is
instantiated both in exact and inexact forms, is struck:

<blockquote>
  ... In order to catch uses of inexact numbers where exact numbers are
  required, Scheme explicitly distinguishes exact from inexact numbers.
  <strike>This distinction is orthogonal to the dimension of type.</strike>
</blockquote>

<!-- The expression <code>(/ (+ 1 (* 5.144 <var>x</var>)) 3)</code> is not -->
<!-- portable across R5RS implementations with inexacts.  This is because, -->
<!-- in an implementation lacking exact rational non-integers, the -->
<!-- <samp>`/'</samp> procedure can signal an error when <var>x</var> is an -->
<!-- exact <samp>`0'</samp>; whereas other exact integers cause no problem. -->
<!-- <p> -->

Some Scheme implementations treat an exact 0 as <em>stronger</em> than
an inexact 0.0; returning 0 for <code>(/ 0 0.0)</code> while signaling
an error for <code>(/ 0.0 0)</code>.  This leads to the use of
exactness coercions to select behavior of <samp>`/'</samp> and
<samp>`expt'</samp>, a practice which can be very opaque.
<p>

Section <a href="#6.2.2">6.2.2 Exactness</a> states:

<blockquote>
  A number is inexact if it was written as an inexact constant, if it
  was derived using inexact ingredients, or if it was derived using
  inexact operations.  Thus inexactness is a contagious property of a
  number.
</blockquote>

But this section also states:

<blockquote>
  An operation may, however, return an exact result if it can prove
  that the value of the result is unaffected by the inexactness of its
  arguments.  For example, multiplication of any number by an exact
  zero may produce an exact zero result, even if the other argument is
  inexact.
</blockquote>

By those paragraphs, <em>inexactness</em> is a contagious property of
all numbers except 0, the only number whose <em>exactness</em> is
contagious!  To resolve this conflict, the latter two sentences are
struck.  This change enhances portability of programs because the
exactness of mixed exactness products and quotients are specified, and
no longer at the discretion of implementations.
<p>

<!-- With inexactness contagion applying to 0, this SRFI specifies that -->
<!-- division of zeros be 0/0 or report a violation of an implementation -->
<!-- restriction so long as one of the zeros is inexact.  By standardizing -->
<!-- this behavior the portability of code will be improved. -->
<!-- <p> -->

<!-- In <a href="#6.2.3">6.2.3 Implementation restrictions</a> a redundant -->
<!-- clause is struck: -->

<!-- <blockquote> -->
<!--   If, however, an -->
<!--   exact number is operated upon so as to produce an inexact result -->
<!--   (as by <SAMP>`sqrt'</SAMP>), -->
<!--   <STRIKE> -->
<!--   and if the result is represented as a flonum, then -->
<!--   the most precise flonum format available must be used; but if the result -->
<!--   is represented in some other way</STRIKE> -->
<!--   then the representation must have at least as -->
<!--   much precision as the most precise flonum format available. -->
<!-- </blockquote> -->

<h3>expt</h3>

In R3RS and R4RS the description of <code>expt</code> is very simple:

<blockquote>
    <dl>
    <dt><u>procedure:</u> <b>expt</b> <i>z1 z2</i>
    </dt><dd><a name="IDX388"></a>


    <p>
    Returns <var>z1</var> raised to the power <var>z2</var>:


    </p><p>
    z_1<font size="-1"><sup>z_2</sup></font> = e<font size="-1"><sup>z_2 log z_1</sup></font>


    </p><p>
    0<font size="-1"><sup>0</sup></font> is defined to be equal to 1.
    </p></dd></dl>
</blockquote>

The simplicity is nice, but in the absence of infinities, the
straightforward scheme implementation

<pre>    (define (expt b x) (exp (* x (log b))))
</pre>

is incapable of operating when <var>b</var> is zero.
<p>
According to G. Sussman, the change in R5RS to
</p><blockquote>
<blockquote>
0<font size="-1"><sup>z</sup></font> is 1 if z = 0 and 0 otherwise.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

was "... attempting to follow Common Lisp and APL when it came to
boundary conditions and branch cuts."  That line failed in its
attempt; in R5RS <code>(expt 0 -1) ==> 1</code>.

<p>
About <code>expt</code>,
<a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/hyperspec/HyperSpec/Body/fun_expcm_expt.html">
Common-Lisp</a> says:

</p><blockquote>
  <code>expt</code> is defined as b<font size="-1"><sup>x</sup></font> = e<font size="-1"><sup>x</sup></font> log b.  This defines the
  principal values precisely.  The range of expt is the entire complex
  plane.  Regarded as a function of x, with b fixed, there is no branch
  cut.  Regarded as a function of b, with x fixed, there is in general a
  branch cut along the negative real axis, continuous with quadrant II.
  The domain excludes the origin.  By definition, 0<font size="-1"><sup>0</sup></font>=1.  If b=0 and the
  real part of x is strictly positive, then b<font size="-1"><sup>x</sup></font>=0.  For all other values
  of x, 0<font size="-1"><sup>x</sup></font> is an error.
</blockquote>

With log(0) being -inf.0, and because exp(-inf.0) is 0.0, Common-Lisp
behavior would follow from:

<pre>    (define (expt b x) (exp (* x (log b))))
</pre>

except when <var>b</var> is zero.
<p>
With <code>(log 0)</code> being -inf.0, the product of <var>x</var> and
-inf.0 determines the trajectory of <code>exp</code>.
<code>Exp</code>'s domain repeats every 2*pi radians in the imaginary
direction.  This multiplication rotates the negative real infinity.
If it rotates into a direction other than pure real, then the limit of
<code>(exp (* b (log x)))</code> does not exist (because of the 2*pi
periodicity).
</p><p>
Common-Lisp's criterion of testing the sign of the real part of
<var>x</var> can be seen as snapping the direction of the product to
either a positive or negative real infinity.

</p><pre>
(exp (* 1 -inf.0))          ==&gt;  0.0
(exp (* -1 -inf.0))         ==&gt;  +inf.0
</pre>

Because Common-Lisp doesn't have explicit infinities, it signals an
error for negative real parts of <var>x</var>.  The Common-Lisp float
behavior, except for <code>(expt 0.0 0.0)</code>, can be produced by

<pre>(define (expt <var>z1</var> <var>z2</var>) (exp (* (if (zero? <var>z1</var>) (real-part <var>z2</var>) <var>z2</var>) (log <var>z1</var>))))
</pre>

<p>
Having real infinities enables these definitions to work when
<var>z1</var> is zero.  Although the simpler definition is
mathematically satisfying, the "real-part" variant allows

<code>(expt 0.0 <var>z</var>)</code> to return something other than
0/0 when the exponent has small imaginary parts due to inexact
inaccuracies.
</p><p>

<pre>(define (expt <var>z1</var> <var>z2</var>)
  (cond ((and (exact? <var>z2</var>) (not (and (zero? <var>z1</var>) (negative? <var>z2</var>))))
	 (integer-expt <var>z1</var> <var>z2</var>))
	((zero? <var>z2</var>) (+ 1 (* <var>z1</var> <var>z2</var>)))
	(else
	 (exp (* (if (zero? <var>z1</var>) (real-part <var>z2</var>) <var>z2</var>) (log <var>z1</var>))))))
</pre>
<!-- 	((and (real? <var>z2</var>) (real? <var>z1</var>) (positive? <var>z1</var>)) -->
<!-- 	 (real-expt <var>z1</var> <var>z2</var>)) -->

In the (above) definition from the reference implementation,
<code>(expt <var>z</var> 0.0)</code> returns 1 or 1.0 when
<var>z</var> is finite; and 0/0 otherwise.

<p>
<code>(expt 0.0 <var>z</var>)</code>, where <var>z</var> has a
negative real-part, returns +inf.0, where Common-Lisp signals an error.
Otherwise the behavior is the same as Common-Lisp's <code>expt</code>.
</p>


<h3>sqrt</h3>

The description of <code>sqrt</code> has been wrong since R3RS.
Prepending "For real <var>z</var>" to the second sentence corrects it.


<h3>Idempotency</h3>

The description of <SAMP>`inexact-&gt;exact'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`exact-&gt;inexact'</SAMP> states:

<blockquote>
  These procedures implement the natural one-to-one correspondence
  between exact and inexact integers throughout an
  implementation-dependent range.
</blockquote>

But what if <SAMP>`inexact-&gt;exact'</SAMP> is passed an exact
number?  Writing code to test exactness before calling
<SAMP>`inexact-&gt;exact'</SAMP> adds opportunities for mistakes with
no compensating benefits.  A paragraph is added to clarify:

<blockquote>
  <SAMP>`Exact-&gt;inexact'</SAMP> given an inexact argument returns
  that argument.
  <SAMP>`Inexact-&gt;exact'</SAMP> given an exact argument returns
  that argument.
  Thus <SAMP>`exact-&#62;inexact'</SAMP> and
  <SAMP>`inexact-&#62;exact'</SAMP> are idempotent.
</blockquote>


<h3>Integer versus Exact</h3>

R5RS describes <code>quotient</code>, <code>remainder</code>, and
<code>modulo</code> as <em>integer</em> operations.  They are
required to work for integers, whether exact or inexact.  The use of
<var>N</var> for names of their arguments similarly declares
<code>gcd</code>, <code>lcm</code>, <code>odd?</code>, and
<code>even?</code> to be integer operations.
<p>
But these operations become poorly behaved for inexacts outside the
range where each integer has a unique representation.  For instance,
all large magnitude IEEE-754 numbers are integers and even (a multiple
of 2) because the radix, and hence the scaling factors, are even.
<!-- <P> -->
<!-- Continuous functions can operate reasonably on approximate numbers. -->
<!-- But the oscillations of <CODE>modulo</CODE> and <CODE>remainder</CODE> -->
<!-- do not reduce as their inputs tend to infinity.  <CODE>gcd</CODE> and -->
<!-- <CODE>lcm</CODE> are wildly discontinuous. -->
</p><p>
Distinguishing these functions on the basis of integer arguments
overlooks their generalizations to exact rational numbers:

</p><pre>    modulo(x/y, w/z) = modulo(lcm(y, z)*x/y, lcm(y, z)*w/z)/lcm(y, z)
    remainder(x/y, w/z) = remainder(lcm(y, z)*x/y, lcm(y, z)*w/z)/lcm(y, z)
    gcd(x/y, w/z) = gcd(x, w)/lcm(y, z)
    lcm(x/y, w/z) = lcm(x, w)/gcd(y, z)
</pre>

SRFI-70 changes the domain of <code>gcd</code> and <code>lcm</code> to
exact rationals.
<p>

Common-Lisp
<a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/hyperspec/HyperSpec/Body/fun_modcm_rem.html">mod and rem</a>
are general to rational and real arguments:

<pre>(mod 2/3 1/5)               ==&gt;  1/15
(mod .666 1/5)              ==&gt;  0.065999985

with the results of these functions.
<p>
One possibility is having those functions also convert to exact, like
the Common-Lisp functions of the same names do.  But implementation of
the extension of <samp>`quotient'</samp>, <samp>`modulo'</samp>, and

<samp>`floor'</samp> and <samp>`truncate'</samp>.

<h3>Inexactness Considered Harmful?</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
  The R5RS specification of numerical operations leads to unportable
  and intransparent behavior of programs.  Specifically, the notion of
  "exact/inexact numbers" and the misleading distinction between
  "real" and "rational" numbers are two primary sources of confusion.
  Consequently, the way R5RS organizes numbers is significantly less
  useful than it could be.  Based on this diagnosis, we propose to
  abandon the concept of exact/inexact numbers from Scheme altogether.
  In this paper, we examine designs in which exact and inexact
  rounding operations are explicitly separated, while there is no
  distinction between exact and inexact numbers.  Through examining
  alternatives and practical ramifications, we arrive at an
  alternative proposal for the design of the numerical operations in
  Scheme.
</blockquote>

In my view the essential distinction of number-theoretic operations is
that they are <em>exact</em>, not that they are <em>integer</em> as
R5RS holds.  This SRFI addresses the issue by extending most of the
integer procedures to other numeric types.  Restricting the integer
operations to exact integer arguments would also work.
<p>
<cite>Cleaning up the Tower</cite> demotes the exactness property
relative to types while this SRFI promotes it.  Yet both find that the
exactness of procedures should play a more important role in
determining the exactness of numerical results.
</p><p>
In their proposed system:

</p><blockquote>
  Any program that does not contain calls to floating-point operations
  always computes exactly and reproducibly, independent of the Scheme
  implementation it runs on.
</blockquote>

This will require either
<ul>

<li> mandating Scheme implementations to support exact rational
bignums; or

</li><li> disallowing numeric routines from returning exact rational
numbers.

</li></ul>

As an author of a Scheme implementation, I find the first option
unappealing; coding a complicated feature to solve a problem that the
implementation doesn't have.  If some feature must be jettisoned, then
removing exact rational non-integers might be a simpler and less
wrenching alternative than removing exactness as an organizing
principle.  Experience with SCM shows that the R5RS number system can
work well without exact rational non-integers.
<p>
Full reproducibility will require extensive changes to R5RS:

</p><ul>

<li>The removal of optional status for the R5RS procedures
<samp>`transcript-on'</samp>, <samp>`transcript-off'</samp>,
<samp>`load'</samp>, <samp>`with-output-to-file'</samp>,
<samp>`with-input-to-file'</samp>, and
<samp>`interaction-environment'</samp>; as well as multi-argument
varieties of <samp>`/'</samp> and <samp>`-'</samp>.

</li><li>The phrase "is an error" occurs 22 times in R5RS.  The response to
all of those conditions must be explicitly specified.

</li></ul>

The reproducibility condition is too strong; it needs restrictions so
that it doesn't expose properties of the host file system.

<!-- <P> -->
<!-- Is easy reproducibility of programs being oversold?  Well-conditioned -->
<!-- inexact computations are reproducible in the sense that the variation -->
<!-- in results will be small.  To my knowledge there is no shortcut around -->
<!-- the necessary numerical analysis. -->
<!-- <P> -->
<!-- All high quality pseudo-random-number generators are exact and often -->
<!-- reversible.  There are important exact random algorithms, such as -->
<!-- primality tests (Solovay-Strassen), polynomial factorization, theorem -->
<!-- proving, and in graph-theory. -->
<p>

</p><h3>Clean Infinities</h3>

The treatment of infinities by <cite>"Cleaning up the Tower"</cite>
also differs from this SRFI.

<blockquote>
  ... an exact division by zero is virtually always a symptom of a
  genuine programming error or of illegal input data, and the
  introduction of infinity will only mask this error.
</blockquote>

This is not the case in the R5RS model, where substitution of exact
for inexact does not change the computation.
<p>

</p><blockquote>
  The advantage of returning NaN instead of raising an error is that
  the computation still continues, postponing the interpretation of
  the results to a more convenient point in the program.  In this way,
  NaN is quite useful in numerical computations.
</blockquote>

While finding +inf.0 and -inf.0 to be very useful in computation, I
cannot say the same for 0/0.  It usually arises as the result of
operating on a real infinity.  Tolerating one error is useful;
tolerating more than one error in a computation masks programming
errors.  That is why this SRFI leaves to the implementation whether to
report a violation of an implementation restriction or return 0/0.

<blockquote>
  The problem with NaN is that the program control structure will
  mostly not recognize the NaN case explicitly.  Assume we define
  comparisons with NaN always to result in #f, as IEEE 754 does, then
  <pre>(do ((x NaN (+ x 1))) ((&gt; x 10)))</pre>
  will hang but
  <pre>(do ((x NaN (+ x 1))) ((not (&lt;= x 10))))</pre>
  will stop, which is counter-intuitive and may be surprising.
</blockquote>

Because it has no sensible place in the total-order of real numbers,
0/0 is not a real number.  Thus it is an illegal argument to the
comparison procedures <samp>`&lt;'</samp>, <samp>`&lt;='</samp>,
<samp>`&gt;'</samp>, and <samp>`&gt;='</samp>.

<blockquote>
  While +inf, -inf, and NaN are quite useful for inexact computations,
  there is a high price to pay when they are carried over into the
  exact world: The rational numbers must be extended by the special
  objects, and the usual algebraic laws will not hold for the
  extension anymore.
</blockquote>

This need not be the case.  This "high price" is a consequence of the
proposed (section 5) "type permeability" kinds #2 and #3, which
prohibit exact arguments to inexact procedures.
<p>
As <a href="#exact%20infinities">shown earlier</a>, infinities are
always inexact.  Infinities being inexact makes detecting them in
exact calculations easier.  Not only will the <samp>`finite?'</samp>,
<samp>`rational?'</samp>, and <samp>`exact?'</samp> procedures return
<samp>`#f'</samp> for infinities; but passing infinities to exact-only
or integer-only procedures is an error.

<P>



<P>
Numerical computation has traditionally been neglected by the Lisp
community.  Until Common Lisp there was no carefully thought out
strategy for organizing numerical computation, and with the exception
of the MacLisp system <A HREF="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~jaffer/r5rs_13.html#BIB20">[Pitman83]</A>
little effort was made to execute numerical code efficiently.  This
report recognizes the excellent work of the Common Lisp committee and
accepts many of their recommendations.  In some ways this report
simplifies and generalizes their proposals in a manner consistent with
the purposes of Scheme.


<P>
It is important to distinguish between the mathematical numbers, the
Scheme numbers that attempt to model them, the machine representations
used to implement the Scheme numbers, and notations used to write numbers.
This report uses the types <I>number</I>, <I>complex</I>, <I>real</I>,
<I>rational</I>, and <I>integer</I> to refer to both mathematical numbers
and Scheme numbers.  Machine representations such as fixed point and
floating point are referred to by names such as <I>fixnum</I> and
<I>flonum</I>.



<A NAME="6.2.1"></A>
<H3>6.2.1 Numerical types</H3>

<P>



<P>
Mathematically, numbers may be arranged into a tower of subtypes
in which each level is a subset of the level above it:



<PRE>
          number
          complex
          real
          rational
          integer
</PRE>

<P>
For example, 3 is an integer.  Therefore 3 is also a rational,
a real, and a complex.  The same is true of the Scheme numbers
that model 3.  For Scheme numbers, these types are defined by the
predicates <CODE>number?</CODE>, <CODE>complex?</CODE>, <CODE>real?</CODE>, <CODE>rational?</CODE>,




and <CODE>integer?</CODE>.



<P>
There is no simple relationship between a number's type and its
representation inside a computer.  Although most implementations of
Scheme will offer at least two different representations of 3, these
different representations denote the same integer.


<P>
Scheme's numerical operations treat numbers as abstract data, as
independent of their representation as possible.  Although an implementation
of Scheme may use fixnum, flonum, and perhaps other representations for
numbers, this should not be apparent to a casual programmer writing
simple programs.


<P>
It is necessary, however, to distinguish between numbers that are
represented exactly and those that may not be.  For example, indexes
into data structures must be known exactly, as must some polynomial
coefficients in a symbolic algebra system.  On the other hand, the
results of measurements are inherently inexact, and irrational numbers
may be approximated by rational and therefore inexact approximations.
In order to catch uses of inexact numbers where exact numbers are
required, Scheme explicitly distinguishes exact from inexact numbers.
<STRIKE>This distinction is orthogonal to the dimension of type.</STRIKE>



<A NAME="6.2.2"></A>
<H3>6.2.2 Exactness</H3>

<P>



<P>

Scheme numbers are either <I>exact</I> or <I>inexact</I>.  A number is
exact if it was written as an exact constant or was derived from
exact numbers using only exact operations.  A number is
inexact if it <FONT COLOR=red>is infinite, if it </FONT>was written as an inexact constant,
if it was
derived using inexact ingredients, or if it was derived using
inexact operations. Thus inexactness is a contagious
property of a number.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=red>Each exact number corresponds to a single mathematical number.  It is</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=red>the programmer's responsibility to avoid using exact numbers with</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=red>magnitude or precision too large to be represented in the</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=red>implementation.</FONT>
<!-- <P> -->
<!-- Although real infinities provide a representation of real numbers of -->
<!-- arbitrarily large magnitude, -->
<FONT COLOR=red>For inexact numbers,</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=red>it is the programmer's responsibility to</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=red>avoid using</FONT>
<!-- non-real -->
<FONT COLOR=red>complex numbers with magnitude too large to be</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=red>represented in the implementation.</FONT>


<P>
If two implementations produce exact results for a
computation that did not involve inexact intermediate results,
the two ultimate results will be mathematically equivalent.  This is
generally not true of computations involving inexact numbers
<STRIKE>since</STRIKE> <FONT COLOR=red>because</FONT>
approximate methods such as floating point arithmetic may be used,
but it is the duty of each implementation to make the result as close as
practical to the mathematically ideal result.


<P>
Rational operations such as <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> should always produce
exact results when given exact arguments.
If the operation is unable to produce an exact result,
then it may either report the violation of an implementation restriction
or it may silently coerce its
result to an inexact value.
See section <A HREF="#6.2.3">6.2.3 Implementation restrictions</A>.

the operations
described in this section must
<STRIKE>generally</STRIKE>
return inexact results when given any inexact arguments.
<STRIKE>
An operation may, however, return an exact result if it can prove that
the value of the result is unaffected by the inexactness of its
arguments.  For example, multiplication of any number by an exact zero
may produce an exact zero result, even if the other argument is
inexact.

<A NAME="6.2.3"></A>
<H3>6.2.3 Implementation restrictions</H3>

<P>



<P>



<P>
Implementations of Scheme are not required to implement the whole
tower of subtypes given in section <A HREF="#6.2.1">6.2.1 Numerical types</A>,
but they must implement a coherent subset consistent with both the
purposes of the implementation and the spirit of the Scheme language.
For example, an implementation in which all numbers are real
may still be quite useful.


<P>
Implementations may also support only a limited range of numbers of
any type, subject to the requirements of this section.  The supported
range for exact numbers of any type may be different from the
supported range for inexact numbers of that type.  For example,
an implementation that uses flonums to represent all its
inexact real numbers may
support a practically unbounded range of exact integers
and rationals
while limiting the range of inexact reals (and therefore
the range of inexact integers and rationals)
to the dynamic range of the flonum format.
Furthermore
the gaps between the representable inexact integers and
rationals are
likely to be very large in such an implementation as the limits of this
range are approached.


<P>
An implementation of Scheme must support exact integers
throughout the range of numbers that may be used for indexes of
lists, vectors, and strings or that may result from computing the length of a
list, vector, or string.  The <CODE>length</CODE>, <CODE>vector-length</CODE>,


and <CODE>string-length</CODE> procedures must return an exact

integer, and it is an error to use anything but an exact integer as an
index.  Furthermore any integer constant within the index range, if
expressed by an exact integer syntax, will indeed be read as an exact
integer, regardless of any implementation restrictions that may apply
outside this range.  Finally, the procedures listed below will always
return an exact integer result provided all their arguments are exact integers
and the mathematically expected result is representable as an exact integer
within the implementation:



<PRE>

+            -             *
quotient     remainder     modulo
max          min           abs
numerator    denominator   gcd
lcm          floor         ceiling
truncate     round         rationalize
expt<!--          exact-floor  exact-ceiling -->
<!-- exact-truncate            exact-round -->

</PRE>

<P>
Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to support exact
integers and exact rationals of practically unlimited size and
precision, and to implement the above procedures and the
<SAMP>`/'</SAMP> procedure in such a way that they always return exact
results when given exact arguments.  If one of these procedures is
unable to deliver an exact result when given exact arguments, then it
may either report a violation of an implementation restriction or it
may silently coerce its result to an inexact number.  Such a coercion
may cause an error later.

<P>
An implementation may use floating point and other approximate
representation strategies for inexact numbers.

<P>
This report recommends, but does not require, that the IEEE 32-bit
and 64-bit floating point standards be followed by implementations that use
flonum representations, and that implementations using
other representations should match or exceed the precision achievable
using these floating point standards <A HREF="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~jaffer/r5rs_13.html#BIB12">[IEEE]</A>.


<P>
In particular, implementations that use flonum representations
must follow these rules: A flonum result
must be represented with at least as much precision as is used to express any of
the inexact arguments to that operation.  It is desirable (but not required) for
potentially inexact operations such as <SAMP>`sqrt'</SAMP>, when applied to exact
arguments, to produce exact answers whenever possible (for example the
square root of an exact 4 ought to be an exact 2).
If, however, an
exact number is operated upon so as to produce an inexact result
(as by <SAMP>`sqrt'</SAMP>),

and if the result is represented as a flonum, then
the most precise flonum format available must be used; but if the result
is represented in some other way

then the representation must have at least as
much precision as the most precise flonum format available.

<P>
Although Scheme allows a variety of written
notations for
numbers, any particular implementation may support only some of them.
For example, an implementation in which all numbers are real
need not support the rectangular and polar notations for complex
numbers.  If an implementation encounters an exact numerical constant that
it cannot represent as an exact number, then it may either report a
violation of an implementation restriction or it may silently represent the
constant by an inexact number.


<A NAME="6.2.4"></A>
<H3>6.2.4 Syntax of numerical constants</H3>

<P>



<P>
The syntax of the written representations for numbers is described formally in
section <A HREF="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~jaffer/r5rs_9.html#7.1.1">7.1.1 Lexical structure</A>.  Note that case is not significant in numerical
constants.


<P>
A number may be written in binary, octal, decimal, or
hexadecimal by the use of a radix prefix.  The radix prefixes are <SAMP>`#b'</SAMP> (binary), <SAMP>`#o'</SAMP> (octal), <SAMP>`#d'</SAMP> (decimal), and <SAMP>`#x'</SAMP> (hexadecimal).  With




no radix prefix, a number is assumed to be expressed in decimal.


<P>
A
numerical constant may be specified to be either exact or
inexact by a prefix.  The prefixes are <SAMP>`#e'</SAMP>

for exact, and <SAMP>`#i'</SAMP> for inexact.  An exactness

prefix may appear before or after any radix prefix that is used.  If
the written representation of a number has no exactness prefix, the
constant may be either inexact or exact.  It is inexact if it contains
a decimal point, an exponent, a "#" character in the place of a <FONT COLOR=red>digit;</FONT>
otherwise it is exact.

<P>
<FONT COLOR=red>Negative infinity is written </FONT><SAMP><FONT COLOR=red>`-inf.0'</FONT></SAMP><FONT COLOR=red>.  Positive infinity</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=red>is written </FONT><SAMP><FONT COLOR=red>`+inf.0'</FONT></SAMP><FONT COLOR=red>.</FONT>

<P>
In systems with inexact numbers
of varying precisions it may be useful to specify
the precision of a constant.  For this purpose, numerical constants
may be written with an exponent marker that indicates the
desired precision of the inexact
representation.  The letters <SAMP>`s'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`f'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`d'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`l'</SAMP> specify the use of <VAR>short</VAR>, <VAR>single</VAR>,
<VAR>double</VAR>, and <VAR>long</VAR> precision, respectively.  (When fewer
than four internal
inexact
representations exist, the four size
specifications are mapped onto those available.  For example, an
implementation with two internal representations may map short and
single together and long and double together.)  In addition, the
exponent marker <SAMP>`e'</SAMP> specifies the default precision for the
implementation.  The default precision has at least as much precision
as <VAR>double</VAR>, but
implementations may wish to allow this default to be set by the user.

<P>
The examples used in this section assume that any numerical constant written
using an exact notation is indeed represented as an exact
number.  Some examples also assume that certain numerical constants written
using an inexact notation can be represented without loss of
accuracy; the inexact constants were chosen so that this is
likely to be true in implementations that use flonums to represent
inexact numbers.

<SAMP>`Rationalize'</SAMP> returns the <EM>simplest</EM> rational number
differing from <VAR>x</VAR> by no more than <VAR>y</VAR>.  A rational number r_1 is
<EM>simpler</EM>  than another rational number

r_2 if r_1 = p_1/q_1 and r_2 = p_2/q_2 (in lowest terms) and |p_1|&#60;= |p_2| and |q_1| &#60;= |q_2|.  Thus 3/5 is simpler than 4/7.
Although not all rationals are comparable in this ordering (consider 2/7
and 3/5) any interval contains a rational number that is simpler than
every other rational number in that interval (the simpler 2/5 lies
between 2/7 and 3/5).  Note that 0 = 0/1 is the simplest rational of
