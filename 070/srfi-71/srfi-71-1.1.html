<H1>Abstract</H1>

This SRFI is a proposal for extending <code>let</code>,
<code>let*</code>, and <code>letrec</code>
for receiving multiple values.
The syntactic extension is fully compatible with the existing syntax.
It is the intention that single-value bindings, 
i.e. <code>(let ((var expr)) ...)</code>, and
multiple-value binding can be mixed freely and conveniently.
<p>
The most simple form of the new syntax is best explained by an example:
<p>
<pre>
(define (quo-rem x y)
  (values (quotient x y) (remainder x y)))

(define (quo x y)
  (let ((q r (quo-rem x y)))
    q))
</pre>
The procedure <code>quo-rem</code> delivers two values to
its continuation. These values are received as <code>q</code>
and <code>r</code> in the <code>let</code>-expression of the
procedure <code>quo</code>.
In other words, the syntax of <code>let</code> is extended such
that several variables can be specified---and these variables
receive the values delivered by the expression <code>(quo-rem x y)</code>.
<p>
The syntax of <code>let</code> is further extended to cases in which
a rest argument receives the list of all residual values.
Again by example, 
<pre>
(let (((values y1 y2 . y3+) (foo x)))
   body)
</pre>
In this example, <code>values</code> is a syntactic keyword 
indicating the presence of multiple values to be received,
and <code>y1</code>, <code>y2</code>, and <code>y3+</code>, 
resp., are variables bound to the first value, the second value,
and the list of the remaining values, resp., as produced by 
<code>(foo x)</code>.
The syntactic keyword <code>values</code> allows receiving
all values as in <code>(let ((values . xs) (foo x)) body)</code>.
It also allows receiving no values at all as in 
<code>(let ((values) (for-each foo list)) body)</code>.
<p>
A common application of binding multiple values is
decomposing data structures into their components.
This mechanism is illustrated in its most primitive form as follows:
The procedure <code>uncons</code> (defined below) 
decomposes a pair <code>x</code> into its car and its cdr
and delivers them as two values to its continuation.
Then an extended <code>let</code> can receive these values:
<pre>
(let ((car-x cdr-x (uncons x)))
  (foo car-x cdr-x))
</pre>
Of course, for pairs this method is probably neither faster 
nor clearer than using the procedures <code>car</code>
and <code>cdr</code>.
However, for data structures doing substantial work upon
decomposition this is different: Extracting the element of
highest priority from a priority queue, while at the
same time constructing the residual queue,
can both be more efficient and more convenient than
doing both operations independently.
In fact, the <code>quo-rem</code> example illustrates this
point already as both quotient and remainder are probably
computed by a common exact division algorithm.
(And often caching is used to avoid executing this
algorithm twice as often as needed.)
<p>
As the last feature of this SRFI, a mechanism is specified
to store multiple values in heap-allocated data structures.
For this purpose, <code>values->list</code> and <code>values->vector</code>
construct a list (a vector, resp.) storing all values delivered 
by evaluating their argument expression.
Note that these operations cannot be procedures.

<H1>Rationale</H1>

My original motivation for writing this SRFI is my unhappiness with
the current state of affairs in Scheme with respect to multiple values.
Multiple values are mandatory in the
Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic
Language Scheme (<a href="#R5RS">R5RS</a>),
and they are fully available in all major Scheme implementations.
Yet there is often a painful hesitation about using them.
<p>
The reason for this hesitation is that multiple values are
nearly fully integrated into Scheme---but not quite.
(Unlike for example in the languages Matlab, Octave, or
the computer algebra system Magma, in which returning
multiple values from a function is the most natural thing
in the world: <code>q, r := quo_rem(x, y);</code>)
However, considerable progress has been made on this point,
and I understand this SRFI as a minor contribution 
"placing the last corner stone".
But first a very brief history of multiple values in Scheme,
as far as relevant for this SRFI.
<p>
<a href="#R5RS">R5RS</a> specifies the procedures <code>values</code>
and <code>call-with-values</code> for passing any number of values
from a producer procedure to a consumer procedure. 
This is the only construct in R5RS 
dealing with multiple values explicitly, and it is sufficient
to implement anything that can be implemented for multiple values.
<p>
However, as John David Stone observed in <a href="#SRFI8">SRFI&nbsp;8</a>,
the mechanism exposes explicitly how multiple values are 
passed---but that is hardly ever interesting.
In fact, <code>call-with-values</code> is often clumsy because
the continuations are made explicit.
<a href="#SRFI8">SRFI&nbsp;8</a> improves on this situation
by adding the special form 
<code>(receive &lt;formals&gt; &lt;expression&gt; &lt;body&gt;)</code>
for receiving several values produced by the expression
in variables specified by <code>&lt;formals&gt;</code> and
using them in the body.
<p>
The major limitation of <code>receive</code> is that it can only 
handle a single expression, which means programs dealing with
multiple values frequently get deeply nested.
<a href="#SRFI11">SRFI&nbsp;11</a> provides a more versatile construct:
<code>Let-values</code> and <code>let*-values</code> are
modelled after <code>let</code> and <code>let*</code> but
replace <code>&lt;variable&gt;</code> by an argument list
with the syntax of <code>&lt;formals&gt;</code>.
The <code>let-values</code> binding construct makes multiple
values about as convenient as it will ever get in Scheme.
Its primary shortcoming is that <code>let-values</code> is
incompatible with the existing syntax of <code>let</code>:
In <code>(let-values ((v x)) ...)</code> is <code>v</code> bound
to the list of all values delivered by <code>x</code> (as in <a href="#SRFI11">SRFI&nbsp;11</a>)?
Or is <code>x</code> to deliver a single value to be
bound to <code>v</code> (as in <code>let</code>)?
Refer to the 
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-11/mail-archive/threads.html">discussion
archive of SRFI 11</a> for details.
Moreover, <code>let-values</code> suffers from "parenthesis complexity",
despite Scheme programmers are tolerant to braces.
<p>
Eli Barzilay's <a href="#Eli">Swindle</a> library (for MzScheme) on 
the other hand redefines let to include multiple-values and internal
procedures: The syntactic keyword <code>values</code> indicates the
presence of multiple values, while additional parentheses (with the
syntax of <code>&lt;formals&gt;</code>)
indicate a <code>lambda</code>-expression as right-hand side.
<p>
This SRFI follows Eli's approach, while keeping the syntax
simple (few parentheses and concepts) and adding tools for
dealing more conveniently with multiple values.
The aim is convenient integration of multiple values into Scheme,
at full coexistence with the existing syntax (<a href="#R5RS">R5RS</a>.)
This is achieved by extending the syntax in two different
ways (multiple left-hand sides or a syntactic keyword)
and adding operations to convert between (implictly passed)
values and (first class) data structures.
<p>
Finally, I would like to mention that Oscar Waddell et al.
describe an efficient compilation method for Scheme's 
<code>letrec</code> (<a href="#Fix">Fixing Letrec</a>)
and propose a <code>letrec*</code> binding construct
to as a basis for internal <code>define</code>.
I expect their compilation method (and <code>letrec*</code>)
and this SRFI to be fully compatible with one another,
although I have not checked this claim by way of implementation.

<H1>Specification</H1>

The syntax of Scheme (<a href="#R5RS">R5RS</a>, Section 7.1.3.)
is extended by replacing the existing production:

<pre>
&lt;binding spec&gt; --&gt; (&lt;variable&gt; &lt;expression&gt;)
</pre>

by the three new productions

<pre>
&lt;binding spec&gt; --&gt; ((values &lt;variable&gt;*) &lt;expression&gt;)
&lt;binding spec&gt; --&gt; ((values &lt;variable&gt;* . &lt;variable&gt;) &lt;expression&gt;)
&lt;binding spec&gt; --&gt; (&lt;variable&gt;+ &lt;expression&gt;)
</pre>

The form <code>(&lt;variable&gt;+ &lt;expression&gt;)</code> is just
an abbreviation for <code>((values &lt;variable&gt;+) &lt;expression&gt;)</code>,
and it includes the original <code>&lt;binding spec&gt;</code> of <a href="#R5RS">R5RS</a>.
<p>
The first two forms are evaluated as follows: The variables are bound and
the expression is evaluated according to the enclosing construct
(either <code>let</code>, <code>let*</code>, or <code>letrec</code>.)
However, the expression may deliver any number of values to its continuation, 
which stores these values into the variables specified, 
possibly allocating a rest list in case of the <code>. &lt;variable&gt;</code> form. 
<p>
The number of values delivered by the expression must match the
number of values expected by the binding specification.
Otherwise an error is raised, as <code>call-with-values</code> would.
This implies in particular, that each binding of a named let involves
exactly one value, because this binding can also be an argument to a
lambda-expression.

<h3>Standard operations</h3>

The following procedures, specified in terms of standard procedures,
are added to the set of standard procedures:

<pre>
(define (uncons   pair)   (values (car pair) (cdr pair)))
(define (unlist   list)   (apply values list))
(define (unvector vector) (apply values (vector->list vector)))
</pre>

These procedures decompose the standard concrete data structures
(pair, list, vector) and deliver the components as values.
It is an error if the argument cannot be decomposed as expected.
Note that the procedures are not necessarily implemented by
the definition given above.

Finally, the following two macros are added to the standard macros:

<pre>
(values->list   &lt;expression&gt;)
(values->vector &lt;expression&gt;)
</pre>

These operation receive all values (if any) delivered by their 
argument expression and return a newly allocated list (vector, resp.)
of these values.

<H1>Design Rationale</H1>

<h3>Why not also include a syntax for procedures?</h3>

This SRFI is a proposal for extending the syntax of <code>let</code>
etc. in order to include multiple values.
It is also desireable to extend the syntax of <code>let</code> 
for simplifying the definition of local procedures.
(For example, as in <a href="#Swindle">Swindle</a>.)
However, this SRFI does not include this feature.
<p>
The reason I have chosen not restrict this SRFI to a syntax
for multiple values is simplicity.

<h3>Why the names <code>unlist</code> etc.?</h3>

An alternative naming convention for the decomposition
operation <code>unlist</code> is <code>list->values</code>,
which is a more symmetrical with respecto to its
inverse operation <code>list->values</code>.
<p>
This symmetry ends, however, as soon as more complicated
data structures with other operations are involved.
Then it becomes aparent that the same data structure can
support different decomposition operations:
A double-ended queue (deque) for example supports splitting off
the head and splitting of the tail; and neither of these
operations should be named <code>deque->values</code>.
The <code>un</code>-convention covers this in a natural way.

<H1>Implementation</H1>

The reference implementation is written in <a href="#R5RS">R5RS</a> 
using hygienic macros, only.
It is not possible, however, to portably detect read access to
an uninitialized variable introduced by <code>letrec</code>.
The definition of the actual functionality can be found 
<a href="letvalues.scm">here</a>.
The implementation defines macros <code>srfi-let/*/rec</code> etc.
in terms of <code>r5rs-let/*/rec</code>.
Implementors may use this to redefine (or even reimplement)
<code>let/*/rec</code> in terms of <code>srfi-let/*/rec</code>,
while providing implementations of <code>r5rs-let/*/rec</code>.
An efficient method for the latter is given in <a href="#Fix">Fixing Letrec</a>
by O. Waddell et al.
<p>
<i>R5RS:</i>
For trying out the functionality, a complete implementation under
<a href="#R5RS">R5RS</a> can be found <a href="letvalues-r5rs.scm">here</a>. 
It defines <code>r5rs-let/*/rec</code> in terms of <code>lambda</code>
and redefines <code>let/*/rec</code> as <code>srfi-let/*/rec</code>.
This may not be the most efficient implementation, because many
Scheme systems handle <code>let</code> etc. specially and do not
reduce it into <code>lambda</code>
<p>
<i>PLT&nbsp;208:</i>
The implementation found <a href="letvalues-plt.scm">here</a>
uses <a href="#PLT">PLT</a>'s module system for exporting 
<code>srfi-let/*/rec</code>
under the name of <code>let/*/rec</code>, while defining
<code>r5rs-let/*/rec</code> as a copy of the built-in
<code>let/*/rec</code>. This code should be efficient.

can be found <a href="examples.scm">here</a>.
