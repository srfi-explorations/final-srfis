   This SRFI is being submitted by members of the Scheme Language
   Editor's Committee as part of the R6RS Scheme standardization
   process.  The purpose of such ``R6RS SRFIs'' is to inform the
   Scheme community of features and design ideas under consideration
   by the editors and to allow the community to give the editors some
   direct feedback that will be considered during the design process.
</p>
<p>
   At the end of the discussion period, this SRFI will be withdrawn.
   When the R6RS specification is finalized, the SRFI may be revised
   to conform to the R6RS specification and then resubmitted with the
   intent to finalize it.  This procedure aims to avoid the situation
   where this SRFI is inconsistent with R6RS.  An inconsistency
   between R6RS and this SRFI could confuse some users.  Moreover it
   could pose implementation problems for R6RS compliant Scheme
   systems that aim to support this SRFI.  Note that departures from
   the SRFI specification by the Scheme Language Editor's Committee
   may occur due to other design constraints, such as design
   consistency with other features that are not under discussion as
   SRFIs.

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>

Unicode is a widespread universal character code that supports most of
the world's (natural) languages.  The extensions to Scheme specified
in this SRFI concern the support of Unicode in Scheme's character,
string and symbol datatypes.  This SRFI does not (fully) specify how
I/O of Unicode data is performed or how Scheme source code is encoded
in files.  These aspects are left for other SRFIs to specify.

</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

<ul>

 <li> The extension of symbol syntax to include all non-whitespace
      characters above Unicode 127 may be too liberal. At the same
      time, it does not extend the set of symbols to include sensible
      ASCII combinations, such as <code>-&gt;</code>. Finally, it may
      not be necessary to place symbols in one-to-one correspondence
      (which motivates the new explicitly-quoted syntax for symbol
      literals).

 <li> C and many other languages (including some Scheme
      implementations) support octal notation within strings and
      characters. Octal notation is not included in this draft because
      the notation seems no longer as popular as other formats (with
      the notable exception of <code>\0</code>), and the
      variable-width encoding is potentially confusing.

 <li> This draft includes both <code>#\newline</code> and
      <code>#\linefeed</code> as character constants. The former is
      compatible with R5RS, but the latter is arguably preferable.
      Maybe we should pick one.

 <li> The syntax for numerical scalar values in character and string
      literals --- using \x, \u, and \U --- avoids the variable-length
      encoding of C's \x, but it's an ad hoc mixture of various
      standards. Another possibility would be to use a delimited
      Scheme number within a string, as in Gambit.

 <li> Here strings might be generalized as in Perl, where multiple
      #<< can appear on a line, and the completing of each follows
      in later lines:

<pre>
        (string-append #&lt;&lt;ONE #&lt;&lt;TWO)
        a b c
        d e f
        ONE
        g h i
        j k l
        TWO
        =&gt; "a b c\nd e fg h i\nj k l"
</pre>

 <li> The <code>\&lt;newline&gt;&lt;intraline-whitespace&gt;</code> may not be necessary.
      Meanwhile, unescaped newlines perhaps should be prohibited in strings.

 <li> The current draft provides no locale-specific operations on
      strings. Probably it belongs in another standard, but a few
      placeholders might be useful here.

</ul>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>

The manipulation of text is a fundamental information processing task.
Increasingly it is important for software to process text in a variety
of natural languages, possibly multiple languages in the same
document.  The Unicode standard specifies how the textual data of most
of the world's languages is represented and handled.  Several
operating systems, programming languages, libraries, and software
tools have now embraced the Unicode standard.  Adding Unicode support
to Scheme, as specified by this SRFI, will allow

<ul>
  <li> multilingual text processing
  <li> internationalization (adaptation of software to the
       linguistic preference of its users)
  <li> improved interoperability with operating systems, programming
       languages, libraries, and software tools that support Unicode
  <li> improved portability of programs between R6RS Scheme
       implementations
</ul>

<h2>Unicode Background</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a>
defines a standard mapping between sequences of <strong>code
points</strong> (integers in the range 0 to #x10FFFF in the latest
version of the standard) and human-readable ``characters.'' More
precisely, Unicode distinguishes between <strong>glyphs</strong>,
which are printed for humans to read, and <strong>characters</strong>,
which are abstract entities that map to glyphs (sometimes in a way
that's sensitive to surrounding characters). Furthermore, different
sequences of code points sometimes correspond to the same
character. The relationships among code points, characters, and glyphs
are subtle and complex.
</p>

<p>
Despite this complexity, most things that a literate human would call
a ``character'' can be represented by a single code point in Unicode
(though there may exist code-point sequences that represent that same
character). For example, Roman letters, Cyrillic letters, Hebrew
consonants, and most Chinese characters fall into this category. Thus,
the ``code point'' approximation of ``character'' works well for many
purposes. It is thus appropriate to define Scheme characters as Unicode
<strong>scalar values</strong>, which includes all code points except
those designated as <strong>surrogates</strong>.  A surrogate is a code
point in the range #xd800 to #xdfff that is used in pairs in the UTF-16
encoding to encode a <strong>supplementary character</strong> (whose
code is in the range #x10000 to #x10ffff).
</p>

<h2>String and Symbol Literals</h2>

<p>
Many programming languages use a lexical syntax for strings that is
similar to the one used by the C language.  In particular, Java has
extended C's notation for Unicode.  Adopting a similar syntax for
Scheme has the advantage of making it easier to learn and remember,
particularly by programmers accustomed to other languages.
</p>

<p> R5RS specifies that the escape sequences <code>\\</code> and
<code>\"</code> can be used in string literals to denote the backslash
and doublequote characters respectively.  This SRFI introduces new
escape sequences so that any Scheme string can be expressed using the
ASCII subset of Unicode. Also, most C string literals have the same
meaning as a Scheme string literal.</p>

<p>This SRFI also extends the lexical syntax of symbols, and it puts
symbols in one-to-one correspondence with immutable strings. In the
revised lexical syntax, most Unicode characters can be used directly
as symbol characters. Furthermore, an explicitly quoted from for
symbols supports an arbitrary sequence of characters in a symbol
literal.</p>

<h2>Locales</h2>

<p>Besides printing and reading characters, humans also compare
character strings, and humans perform operations such as changing
characters to uppercase. To make programs geographically portable,
humans must agree to compare or upcase characters consistently, at
least in certain contexts. The Unicode standard provides such standard
case mappings on scalar values.</p>

<p>In other contexts, global agreement is unnecessary, and the user's
culture should determine a string operation, such as when sorting a
list of file names, perhaps case-insensitively. A locale captures
information about a user's culture-specific interpretation of
character sequences. In particular, a locale determines how strings
are sorted, how a lowercase character is converted to an uppercase
character, and how strings are compared without regard to case.</p>

<p>String operations such as <code>string-ci=?</code> are <b>not</b>
sensitive to the current locale, because they should be portable. A
future SRFI might define operations like
<code>string-locale-ci=?</code> to produce results that are consistent
with the current locale as determined by an implementation.</p>

<h2>Not Addressed in this SRFI</h2>

This SRFI does not address locales, and it does not address encoding
issues, such as how a sequence of bytes in a file is to be decoded
into a sequence of characters, or how a filesystem path is encoded as
a string.

<h1>Specification</h1>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h2>Types</h2>

This SRFI extends or re-defines the standard types <b>character</b>, <b>string</b>,
and <b>symbol</b>.

<h3>Character Type</h3>

<p> The Scheme character type corresponds to the set of Unicode scalar
values.  Specifically, each character corresponds to a number in the
range [0, #xd7ff] union [#xe000, #x10ffff], and properties of the
character are as defined for the corresponding Unicode scalar value.</p>

<p> The <code>integer-&gt;char</code> procedure takes a Unicode scalar
value as an exact integer, it and produces the corresponding
character. The <code>char-&gt;integer</code> procedure takes a
character and produces the corresponding scalar value. It is an error
to call <code>integer-&gt;char</code> with an integer that is not in
the range [0, #xd7ff] union [#xe000, #x10ffff].</p>

<p>Examples:
<pre>
      (integer-&gt;char 32) =&gt; #\space
      (char-&gt;integer (integer-&gt;char 5000)) =&gt; 5000
      (integer-&gt;char #xd800) =&gt; *error*
</pre>
</p>

<h3>String Type</h3>

<p>
Like in R5RS, a Scheme string is a fixed-length array of Scheme
characters.  The procedure call <code>(string-ref <i>str</i>
<i>i</i>)</code> returns the Scheme character at index
<code><i>i</i></code> in the string <code><i>str</code></i>.  The
procedure call <code>(string-set!
<i>str</i> <i>i</i> <i>char</i>)</code> stores the Scheme character
<code><i>char</i></code> at index <code><i>i</i></code> in the string
<code><i>str</i></code>, and an unspecified value is returned.
</p>

<h3>Symbol Type</h3>

<p> A symbol is defined by a sequence of characters. The
<code>string-&gt;symbol</code> procedure works on any string, and
<code>symbol-&gt;string</code> works on any symbol.  </p>


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h2>Lexical Syntax</h2>

The Syntax of Scheme is defined in terms of characters, not bytes, and
remains largely unchanged with the refined definition of character.
This SRFI defines and extends only the lexical syntax of characters,
strings, and symbols.

<h3>Character Lexical Syntax</h3>

<p>
R5RS specifies two lexical syntaxes for characters: named characters,
e.g. <code>#\space</code>, and plain characters, e.g. <code>#\[</code>.
For consistency with the escape sequences of strings and symbols, the
following set of named characters is defined by this SRFI:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <code>#\nul</code> : Unicode 0
  <li> <code>#\alarm</code> : Unicode 7
  <li> <code>#\backspace</code> : Unicode 8
  <li> <code>#\tab</code> : Unicode 9
  <li> <code>#\linefeed</code> : Unicode 10
  <li> <code>#\newline</code> : Unicode 10 (as in R5RS)
  <li> <code>#\vtab</code> : Unicode 11
  <li> <code>#\page</code> : Unicode 12
  <li> <code>#\return</code> : Unicode 13
  <li> <code>#\esc</code> : Unicode 27
  <li> <code>#\space</code> : Unicode 32 (as in R5RS)
  <li> <code>#\rubout</code> : Unicode 127
</ul>

Note that the linefeed character has two external representations:
<code>#\linefeed</code> and <code>#\newline</code>.

<p>
To allow denoting any Unicode character using the ASCII subset of
Unicode and for consistency with the string escape sequences, this
SRFI specifies these escape character syntaxes:

<ul>
  <li> <code>#\x&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;</code> : where <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> is a hexadecimal digit and the sequence of two 
       <code>&lt;x&gt;</code>s forms a hexadecimal number between 0 and #xff
  <li> <code>#\u&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;</code> : where <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> is a hexadecimal digit and the 
       sequence of four <code>&lt;x&gt;</code>s forms a hexadecimal number between 0 and #xffff excluding the range [#xd800, #xdfff]
  <li> <code>#\U&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;</code> : where <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> is 
       a hexadecimal digit and the sequence of eight <code>&lt;x&gt;</code>s forms a hexadecimal number between 0 and #x10ffff 
       excluding the range [#xd800, #xdfff]; the range restriction implies that the first two <code>&lt;x&gt;</code>s
       are <code>0</code>
</ul>

<p>
All character syntaxes are case-sensitive, except that
<code>&lt;x&gt;</code> can be an uppercase or lowercase hexadecimal
digit. Unlike R5RS, every character datum must be followed by a
delimiter. </p>

<p>Examples:
<pre>
  #\xFF       ; Unicode 255
  #\u03BB     ; Unicode 955
  #\U00006587 ; Unicode 25991
  #\&#955;         ; Unicode 955

  #\u006587   ; <i>parse error</i>
  #\&#955;x        ; <i>parse error</i>
  #\alarmx    ; <i>parse error</i>
  #\alarm x   ; Unicode 7 followed by x
  #\Alarm     ; <i>parse error</i>
  #\alert     ; <i>parse error</i>
  #\xFF       ; Unicode 255
  #\xff       ; Unicode 255
  #\x ff      ; Unicode 120 followed by ff
  #\x(ff)     ; Unicode 120 followed by a parenthesized ff
  #\(x)       ; <i>parse error</i>
  #\((x)      ; Unicode 40 followed by a parenthesized x
</pre>

<h3>String Lexical Syntax</h3>

A string can be written in either of two forms: using R5RS-style 
 double quotes, or using a new here-string style.

<h4>Quoted Strings</h4>

As in R5RS, a string datum can be enclosed between double quotes ("),
 where a backslash adjusts the meaning of a character within the
 double quotes. The set of escape sequences is as follows:

<ul>
  <li> <code>\a</code> : alarm, Unicode 7
  <li> <code>\b</code> : backspace, Unicode 8
  <li> <code>\t</code> : tab, Unicode 9
  <li> <code>\n</code> : linefeed, Unicode 10
  <li> <code>\v</code> : vertical tab, Unicode 11
  <li> <code>\f</code> : formfeed, Unicode 12
  <li> <code>\r</code> : return, Unicode 13
  <li> <code>\"</code> : doublequote, Unicode 34
  <li> <code>\'</code> : quote, Unicode 39
  <li> <code>\?</code> : question mark, Unicode 63
  <li> <code>\\</code> : backslash, Unicode 92
  <li> <code>\|</code> : vertical bar, Unicode 124
  <li> <code>\&lt;newline&gt;&lt;intraline-whitespace&gt;</code> : nothing,
       where <code>&lt;newline&gt;</code> is Unicode 10,
       and <code>&lt;intraline-whitespace&gt;</code> is a sequence of non-newline whitescape characters
       (where whitespace is defined in <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-14/">SRFI-14</a>)
  <li> <code>\&lt;space&gt;</code> : space, Unicode 32, where <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> is the character Unicode 32 (useful for
       terminating the previous escape sequence before continuing with whitespace)
  <li> <code>\x&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;</code> : where <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> is a hexadecimal digit and the sequence of two <code>&lt;x&gt;</code>s forms a hexadecimal number between 0 and #xff
  <li> <code>\u&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;</code> : where <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> is a hexadecimal digit and the sequence of four <code>&lt;x&gt;</code>s forms a hexadecimal number between 0 and #xffff excluding the range [#xd800, #xdfff]
  <li> <code>\U&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;</code> : where <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> 
       is a hexadecimal digit 
       and the sequence of eight <code>&lt;x&gt;</code>s forms a hexadecimal number between 0 and #x10ffff excluding the range 
       [#xd800, #xdfff]; the range restriction implies that the first two <code>&lt;x&gt;</code>s
       are <code>0</code>
</ul>

These escape sequences are case-sensitive, except that
<code>&lt;x&gt;</code> can be an uppercase or lowercase hexadecimal
digit.


<p>
Any other character in a string after a backslash is an error.  Any
character outside of an escape sequence and not a doublequote stands
for itself in the string literal.  For example the single-character string
 <code>"&lambda;"</code> (double quote, a lowercase lambda,
double quote) denotes the same string literal as
<code>"\u03bb"</code>.
</p>

<p> Note that the meaning of
<code>\u&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;&lt;x&gt;</code> is slightly
different in Java, because Java handles this escape sequence in the
escape-processing phase, which can be viewed as preprocessing that
precedes lexical analysis.  </p>

<h4>Here Strings</h4>

<p> <b>Here strings</b> are a new syntax for denoting string literals
that eliminates the quoting problem inherent in the traditional string
syntax.  The sequence <code>#&lt;&lt;</code> marks the start of a here
string.  The part of the line after the <code>#&lt;&lt;</code> up to
and including the newline character (Unicode 10) is the <i>key</i>.
The first line afterward that matches the key marks the end of the
here string.  The string contains all the characters between the start
key and the end key, with the exception of the newline before the end
key. The end key can be terminated by an end-of-file instead of a
newline.

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
      #&lt;&lt;THE-END
      printf("hello\n");
      THE-END
        =&gt; "printf(\"hello\\n\");"
      
      #&lt;&lt;THE-END
      printf("hello\n");
      
      THE-END
        =&gt; "printf(\"hello\\n\");\n"
</pre>


<p>
Here strings are particularly useful to include verbatim the text of
some other document, that has its own syntax that might conflict with
the traditional Scheme string syntax, for example a source code
fragment or a TeX document.
</p>

<p>The here string syntax of this SRFI is based on the line-delimited
here strings of Scsh (see <a
href="http://www.scsh.net/docu/html/man.html">Scsh Reference
Manual</a>), which in turn resemble ``here documents'' in shells
such as bash and csh.


<h3>Symbol Lexical Syntax</h3>

<p>The syntax of symbols extends R5RS in three ways.:
<ul>

 <li> Symbols are case-sensitive.

 <li> Where R5RS allows a <code>&lt;letter&gt;</code>, this SRFI allows
      any character whose scalar value is greater than 127 and that is
      not considered whitescape according to <a
      href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-14/">SRFI-14</a>.

 <li> A vertical bar (|) begins a quoted symbol.  Like the
      double-quote character for strings, the vertical-bar character
      indicates both the start and end of a symbol.  The characters between
      the two vertical bars denote the symbol's constituent
      characters, and it is parsed as for strings, including the
      treatment of escape sequences. Unlike strings, double-quote
      characters that are part of the symbol need not be escaped,
      whereas vertical-bar characters in the symbol must be escaped.

</ul>

<p>Examples:
</p>

<pre>
      'Hello =&gt; Hello

      '&lambda; =&gt; &lambda;

      '|Hello| =&gt; Hello

      (symbol-&gt;string '|a "b\" \|c\| \n|) =&gt; "a \"b\" |c| \n"
</pre>


<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->

<h2>Procedures</h2>

This SRFI defines and extends procedures for characters and strings.

<h3>Character Procedures</h3>

<p>Character-comparison procedures are defined as follows:
<pre>
   ;; char-comparator itself is not part of this SRFI; it is
   ;; used only to define other procedures
   (define (char-comparator num-comp)
     (lambda (a-char b-char)
       (num-comp (char-&gt;integer a-char) (char-&gt;integer b-char))))

   (define char=? (char-comparator =))
   (define char&lt;? (char-comparator &lt;))
   (define char&gt;? (char-comparator &gt;))
   (define char&lt;=? (char-comparator &lt;=))
   (define char&gt;=? (char-comparator &gt;=))
</pre>

<p>Unicode defines locale-independent mappings from scalar values to
scalar values for upcase, downcase, and titlecase operations. (These
mappings can be extracted from <a
href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt">UnicodeData.txt</a>
from the Unicode Consortium.) The following Scheme procedures map
characters consistent with the Unicode specification: <ul> <li>
<code>char-upcase</code> <li> <code>char-downcase</code> <li>
<code>char-titlecase</code> </ul>

<p>Case-insensitive character-comparison procedures are defined as
follows:
<pre>
   ;; char-ci-comparator itself is not part of this SRFI; it is
   ;; used only to define other procedures
   (define (char-ci-comparator cs-comp)
     (lambda (a-char b-char)
       (cs-comp (char-downcase a-char) (char-downcase b-char))))

   (define char-ci=? (char-ci-comparator char=?))
   (define char-ci&lt;? (char-ci-comparator char&lt;?))
   (define char-ci&gt;? (char-ci-comparator char&gt;?))
   (define char-ci&lt;=? (char-ci-comparator char&lt;=?))
   (define char-ci&gt;=? (char-ci-comparator char&gt;=?))
</pre>
Programmers should recognize that these procedures may not produce
 results that an end-user would consider sensible with a particular
 locale. This SRFI defines no locale-sensitive comparisons for characters.

<p>The following predicates are as defined by <a
 href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-14/">SRFI-14</a>:
<ul>
 <li> <code>char-alphabetic?</code>
 <li> <code>char-lower-case?</code>
 <li> <code>char-upper-case?</code>
 <li> <code>char-title-case?</code>
 <li> <code>char-numeric?</code>
 <li> <code>char-symbolic?</code>
 <li> <code>char-punctuation?</code>
 <li> <code>char-graphic?</code>
 <li> <code>char-whitespace?</code>
 <li> <code>char-blank?</code>
 <li> <code>char-iso-control?</code>
</ul>

<h3>String Procedures</h3>

<p>The following string procedures are defined as in R5RS, which means
that they are defined by pointwise operation on the string's
characters:
<ul>
 <li> <code>string&lt;?</code>
 <li> <code>string&gt;?</code>
 <li> <code>string=?</code>
 <li> <code>string&lt;=?</code>
 <li> <code>string&gt;=?</code>
 <li> <code>string-ci&lt;?</code>
 <li> <code>string-ci&gt;?</code>
 <li> <code>string-ci=?</code>
 <li> <code>string-ci&lt;=?</code>
 <li> <code>string-ci&gt;=?</code>
</ul>
Programmers should recognize that these procedures may not produce
 results that an end-user would consider sensible with a particular
 locale. This SRFI defines no locale-sensitive comparisons for strings.


<h1>Reference Implementation</h1>

<p> MzScheme version 299.100 and up implements the character and
string operations described in this SRFI. A portable implementation
using R5RS Scheme (to implement a distinct character type) will
accompany the next draft of this SRFI.</p>

<p> The file <a href="r6rs-reader.ss">r6rs-reader.ss</a> implements a
MzScheme-specific reader for the character, string, and symbol syntax
described in this SRFI. This reader uses readtable support from
MzScheme 299.103 and up. It does not fully restrict unquoted symbols
to the syntax of R5RS; for example, <code>-&gt;</code> is parsed as a
symbol. The reference reader does, however, disable MzScheme's
backslash escape for symbols (making an unquoted backslash
illegal).
The file <a href="r6rs-reader.ss">r6rs-reader-test.ss</a>
contains a test suite.
