<h2>Post-finalization note</h2>
  <p>
    After finalization of this SRFI, a discussion (starting <a href="https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-149/msg/6057423">here</a> on the mailing list) revealed that the behaviour of this SRFI when a pattern variable in a subtemplate is followed by more instances of <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code> than the subpattern in which it occurs differs from how implementations of the R6RS handle this case.  While this SRFI specifies that the input subform is repeated for the innermost excess instances of <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code>, the implementations of the R6RS repeat for the outermost excess instances.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is no obvious reason to prefer one convention over the other as there are interesting macros that work with the former convention and not with the latter convention, and vice-versa.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, this means that an implementation supporting the R6RS semantics of <code>syntax-rules</code> can never properly support this SRFI because this SRFI requires that <code>(srfi 149)</code> and <code>(scheme base)</code> export the same <code>syntax-rules</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore, the author of this SRFI now recommends that implementers ignore this extra requirement so that <code>(srfi 149)</code> may export a version of <code>syntax-rules</code> compatible with this SRFI and <code>(scheme base)</code> may export another.  Instead, it is recommended that implementations provide a feature identifier <code>srfi-149-compatible</code> in case the implementation of <code>syntax-rules</code> in <code>(scheme base)</code> has the semantics as specified in this SRFI.
  </p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
The rules for valid <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>s of <code>&lt;syntax
rules&gt;</code> are slightly softened to allow for more than one
consecutive <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code> in subtemplates, and to
allow pattern variables in subtemplates to be followed by more
instances of the identifier <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code> than they are followed in the
subpattern in which they occur.
</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>
The pattern language for <code>syntax-rules</code>-macros as defined
in 4.3.2 of the R7RS, impose two unnatural restrictions on the
validity of templates in syntax rules.
</p>

<p>The first restriction is that an instance of
  the identifier <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code> cannot &mdash; by the formal
  syntax &mdash; immediately follow a <code>&lt;template
  element&gt;</code>, which already ends in an instance of
  the identifier <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>For example, the following expression  is formally an error by the R7RS:</p>

<pre>
 (let-syntax
     ((my-append
      (syntax-rules ()
        ((my-append (a ...) ...) '(a ... ...)))))
   (my-append (1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
</pre>

<p>
  With the extension of the pattern language as described in this
  SRFI &mdash; which is already supported by many Scheme systems
  like <a href="http://synthcode.com/wiki/chibi-scheme">Chibi-Scheme</a>
  and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/">Kawa</a>
  &mdash; 
  the example expression ceases to be an error and instead evaluates
  into the list <code>(1 2 3 4 5 6)</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The second unnatural restriction of the pattern language as
  described in the R7RS is that a difference is made between pattern
  variables that occur in subpatterns followed by no instance of the
  identifier <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code> and those that occur in
  subpatterns followed by one or more instances of the
  identifier <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code>, while there is no logical reason why such a difference
  has to be made.

  This implies that a pattern variable of the first kind can be
  followed by zero or more instances of the
  identifier <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code> in the template, while a
  pattern variable of the second kind can only be followed by as many
  instances of the identifier <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code> as the
  subpattern in which it occurs is followed.
</p>

<p>For example, due to this restriction, transformers as specified by
  the <code>syntax-rules</code>-pattern language of the R7RS cannot
  naturally be lifted to transformers of lists that apply the original
  transformer to each element of the list (compare with
  the <code>map</code>-procedure of Scheme):  If
  <code>((_ . &lt;pattern&gt;) &lt;template&gt;)</code> is a valid
  syntax rule of the <code>syntax-rules</code>-pattern language, the "lifted" rule
  <code>((_ &lt;pattern&gt; ...) (&lt;template&gt; ...))</code> is
  generally not a valid syntax rule.
</p>

<p>
  With the extension of the pattern language as described in this SRFI
  &mdash; which, again, is already supported by at least Chibi-Scheme and Kawa &mdash;
  the "lifted" rule is always valid.  A valid example (which evaluates
  to
  <code>(((bar 1) (bar 2)) ((baz 3) (baz 4)))</code>) is given by:
</p>

<pre>
 (let-syntax
     ((foo
      (syntax-rules ()
        ((foo (a b ...) ...) '(((a b) ...) ...)))))
   (foo (bar 1 2) (baz 3 4)))
</pre>

<p><i>Note: There is at least one logical explanation for the presence
    of the second restriction in the R7RS: Allowing pattern variables
    with non-zero ellipsis count to have extra ellipses in the
    template has an ambiguous meaning without further specification
    (which is given below), in contrast to allowing this for
    zero-ellipsis variables, which is unambiguous.  The ambiguity is
    in which of the ellipses in the template should iterate and which
    should replicate.  In other words, which ones should be considered
    the ellipses that correspond to the ellipses in the pattern, and
    which ones should be considered the extra ellipses.  The R7RS
    doesn't specify it because it doesn't have to since in in the R7RS,
    for any variable, either all of the ellipses in the template
    iterate (because the number of ellipses in the pattern and
    template match), or they all replicate (because there were no
    ellipses for this variable in the pattern).</i></p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>A Scheme system that supports this SRFI should provide the
  library <code>(srfi 149)</code> so that Scheme code can detect
  (using <code>cond-expand</code>) whether the extensions proposed by
  this SRFI are supported by the Scheme system.  The only export
  of <code>(srfi 149)</code> shall be <code>syntax-rules</code> with the same binding as
  <code>syntax-rules</code> from <code>(scheme base)</code>.  Should
  this SRFI at some point formally become part of a new Scheme report
  (<em>e.g.</em> <i>R7RS-large</i>), the library <code>(srfi
  149)</code> becomes obsolete and feature detection should be based
  on the feature identifier that defines the Scheme report in
  question.
</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>In section 7.1.5 of the R7RS, the rule for <code>&lt;template
    element&gt;</code> is changed into the following rule:
</p>

<pre>
 &lt;template element&gt;
   &xrarr; &lt;template&gt;
   &xrarr; &lt;template element&gt; &lt;ellipsis&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Semantics</h2>

<p>The rules in 4.3.2 of the R7RS are extended as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Pattern variables that occur in subpatterns followed by zero or
      more instances of the identifier &lt;ellipsis&gt; are allowed only in
      subtemplates that are followed by as many or more instances of
      <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a pattern variable in a subtemplate is followed by more
      instances of <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code> than the subpattern
      in which it occurs is followed, the input elements by which it
      is replaced in the output are repeated for the innermost excess instances
      of <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code>. <i>(Note: This resolves the ambiguity mentioned above.)</i>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an error if a subtemplate immediately followed by an
      instance of <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code> does not contain at
      least one pattern variable such that the subpattern in which it occurs 
      is followed by as many instances
      of <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    If a template element is immediately followed by more than one
    instance of the identifier <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code>, the
    semantics are analogous to when the instances
    of <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code> are not in immediate succession
    but belonging to nested subtemplates.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>
While it is technically not impossible to implement
the <code>syntax-rules</code> of this SRFI as a custom macro
transformer (see <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-147">SRFI
147</a>) in a portable way on an R7RS system, the benefits of such an
implementation are negligible when weighted against the complexity of
programming such a portable solution (and against its inherent slowness).
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, this SRFI uses Chibi-Scheme's implementation
  of <code>syntax-rules</code> to provide a sample implementation.
  The advantage of Chibi-Scheme's implementation (besides the fact
  that this R7RS system is widely known and used) is that it is a
  portable solution as long as <code>er-macro-transformer</code> is
  available on the host system.

 The implementation of the library <code>(srfi 149)</code> on a
 supporting Scheme system is as simple as possible:

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>
The title of this SRFI is a tribute to the title
of <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-46/srfi-46.html">SRFI
46</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I would like to thank Alex Shinn for having made the free software
  Chibi-Scheme, from which I shamelessly stole the implementation
  of <code>syntax-rules</code>.  Of course, this does not imply that
  he necessarily endorses this SRFI.
</p>

<p>
  I would also like to thank Al Petrofsky who pointed out that the
  need of resolving the ambiguity when lifting the second restriction
  should be made explicit and not just implicit in this SRFI.  I used
  some of his wording on the mailing list while amending this SRFI.
