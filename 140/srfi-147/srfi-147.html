<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
Each syntax definition assigns a macro transformer to a keyword.  The
macro transformer is specified by a transformer spec, which is either
an instance of <code>syntax-rules</code>, an existing syntactic keyword
(including macro keywords and the syntactic keywords that introduce the core forms,
like <code>lambda</code>, <code>if</code>, or <code>define</code>), or
a use of a macro that eventually expands into an instance
of <code>syntax-rules</code>.  In the latter case, the keyword of
macro use is called a <em>custom macro transformer</em>.
</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

<p>
There are currently no issues.
</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>
While the <code>syntax-rules</code>-transformer is in many cases a
simple way to define new keywords in the Scheme language, sometimes more
specialized macro transformers are being called for (<i>e.g.</i>
the <code>computation-rules</code> of SRFI 53).  The current report on
the Scheme language, the R7RS, however, does not describe a means to
define custom macro transformers based on top of syntax rules.
</p>

<p>
Such a means is described in this SRFI, namely allowing macro uses that
eventually expand into a transformer spec in place of transformer spec.
</p>

<p>
  A simple example is given below:
</p>

<pre>
  (define-syntax syntax-rules*
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((syntax-rules* (literal ...) (pattern . templates) ...)
       (syntax-rules (literal ...) (pattern (begin . templates)) ...))
      ((syntax-rules* ellipsis (literal ...) (pattern . templates) ...)
       (syntax-rules ellipsis (literal ...) (pattern (begin . templates)) ...))))

  (let-syntax
      ((foo
       (syntax-rules* ()
         ((foo a b)
          (define a 1)
          (define b 2)))))
    (foo x y)
    (list x y))            &#x27f9; '(1 2)
</pre>

<p>A fairly large use case of this SRFI
is <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-148/srfi-148.html">SRFI 148</a>,
which defines a custom macro transformer for hygienic composable
macros.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>
  A Scheme system supporting this SRFI should apply the requirements
  of this SRFI with respect to <code>syntax-rules</code> <i>mutatis
  mutandis</i> to all other natively provided macro
  transformers, <i>e.g.</i> <code>sc-macro-transformer</code>
  or <code>syntax-case</code>.
</p>
  
<p>
  A Scheme system supporting this SRFI should apply the requirements
  of this SRFI with respect
  to <code>define-syntax</code>, <code>let-syntax</code>,
  and <code>letrec-syntax</code> <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to all other
  natively provided binding facilities for
  keywords, <i>e.g.</i> <code>let-syntax/splicing</code>
  or <code>define-syntax-parameter</code>.
</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

This SRFI extends 7.1.5 of the R7RS as follows:

<pre>
  &lt;transformer spec&gt; 
   -&gt; &lt;keyword&gt;
   -&gt; &lt;macro use&gt;
   -&gt; (begin &lt;definition&gt;&hellip; &lt;transformer spec&gt;)
</pre>

<p>
  Whenever a keyword is bound to a macro transformer, and the macro
  transformer is given by a transformer spec that is a macro use, the
  keyword is bound to the macro transformer given by the transformer
  spec that results from transcribing the macro use.  It is an error
  if the macro use does not expand into a transformer spec (but see
  below).  In case of transformer specs that appear in the bindings of
  the <code>let-syntax</code> binding construct, the expansion of the
  transformer spec takes place in a scope between the outer scope of the binding
  construct and its inner scope.  In case of transformer specs that appear in the bindings of
  the <code>letrec-syntax</code> binding
  constructs, the expansion of the transformer spec takes place in the
  scope of the bindings of the binding construct.
</p>

<p>
  If the transformer spec is a <em>keyword</em>, the keyword bound to
  the transformer spec essentially becomes an alias to the syntactic
  keyword <em>keyword</em>.  (<em>Keyword</em> may also be one of the
  core syntactic keywords
  like <code>lambda</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>define</code>.)
  The same holds if the transformer spec is a macro use that
  eventually expands into a (possibly empty) sequence of multiple definitions followed by
  the <em>keyword</em> (possibly bound by the introduced definitions).
</p>

<p>
  In order to facilitate writing sophisticated custom macro
  transformers, it is allowed that a transformer spec expands into a
  sequence introduced by the keyword <code>begin</code> of multiple
  definitions eventually followed by a transformer spec (whose
  expansion may make use of the introduced definitions).
</p>

<p><i>Note: This form of <code>begin</code> is a fourth form
    of <code>begin</code> different from the forms described in sections
    4.2.3 and sections 5.6.1 of the R7RS.</i>
</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

The sample implementation redefines the following identifiers exported
from the <code>(scheme base)</code> library:
<ul>
  <li><code>define-syntax</code></li>
  <li><code>let-syntax</code></li>
  <li><code>letrec-syntax</code></li>
  <li><code>syntax-rules</code></li>
</ul>

The sample implementation provides these exports through
the <code>(srfi 147)</code> library.  Typical library declarations of a
program or library using <code>(srfi 147)</code> are:

<pre>
  (cond-expand
    (custom-macro-transformers
     (import (scheme base)))
    (else
     (import (except (scheme base)
                     define-syntax
                     let-syntax
                     letrec-syntax
                     syntax-rules))
     (import (srfi 147))))
</pre>

<p>
  For convenience, the sample implementation provides these library
  declaration in the
  file <a href="custom-macro-transformers.scm">custom-macro-transformers.scm</a>
  for inclusion via <code>include-library-declarations</code>.
</p>

<p>
A Scheme system properly supporting this SRFI should ensure that the bindings
of <code>define-syntax</code>, <code>let-syntax</code>,
<code>letrec-syntax</code>, and <code>syntax-rules</code> exported
from <code>(scheme base)</code> and <code>(srfi 147)</code> are
respectively the same.  Such a Scheme system should provide the
feature identifier <code>custom-macro-transformers</code>.  This
cannot be achieved by a fully portable implementation using only the
R7RS without redefining <code>(scheme base)</code>.

beautiful <code>syntax-rules</code>-macro facility, which seems to be
an indispensable and defining part of contemporary Scheme.
