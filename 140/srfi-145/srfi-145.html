<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
A means to denote the invalidity of certain code paths in a Scheme
program is proposed.  It allows Scheme code to turn the evaluation
into a user-defined error that need not be signalled by the
implementation.  Optimizing compilers may use these denotations to
produce better code and to issue better warnings about dead code.
</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

<p>There are currently no issues.</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>
The R7RS requires some operations to signal an error when they fail.
Signalling an error means, among other things, that a non-continuable
exception is raised.  Such exceptions can be handled by exception
handlers; in particular, signalling an error is observable behaviour in a Scheme program.
</p>

<p>
In all other error situations, implementations &mdash; while not
required &mdash; are encouraged to detect and report the error, but
they do not have to signal the error as if <code>raise</code> was
invoked.
</p>

<p>
The <code>error</code> procedure of the R7RS gives a Scheme program a
means to signal user-defined errors.  However, there is no canonical
way to turn the evaluation of a piece of Scheme code into a
user-defined error that is not signalled.  Consider the following definition:
</p>

<pre>
(define (f x)
  (unless (exact-integer? x)
    (error "f: argument is not an integer" x))
  (g (* x x)))
</pre>

<p>
It is the intention to express that invoking the
procedure <code>f</code> with any argument but an exact integer is an
error.  However it is (usually) not important that such an error
situation can be handled by an exception handler (in the Java
programming language, one would probably use an <em>unchecked
exception</em>).  So the above program is over-specifying.  While an
optimizing compiler on which the definition is evaluated may assume
that <code>x</code> is an exact integer after the first expression in
the procedure body (and thus may emit specialised monomorphic code afterwards),
it must not eliminate the first expression in the procedure body
because calling <code>f</code> with a non-exact-integer argument has
different observable behaviour than calling just <code>(g (* x
x))</code>.
</p>

<p>Given that <code>f</code> is called a lot in the code and that
performance is important, the programmer may thus decide that it is
better to comment out the test at the beginning of the procedure body
in non-debug situations:
</p>

<pre>
(define (f x)
  (cond-expand
    (debug
     (unless (exact-integer? x)
       (error "f: argument is not an integer" x)))
    (else #f))
  (g (* x x)))
</pre>

<p>
However, this code (when the feature identifier <code>debug</code> is
not defined) may even be less performant than the first solution: An
optimizing implementation now has no way (in case <code>g</code> is
not well-known) to detect that <code>x</code> is always supposed to be
an exact integer in the code path of the procedure body.  So the
compiler has to emit slow, polymorphic code that works on either
number type.
</p>

<p>
To remedy these problems, this SRFI specifies a way to denote error
situations that are not supposed to be recoverable and which is
helpful for debugging and for the control and data flow analysis of
optimizing compilers.  For implementations conforming to this SRFI,
the procedure <code>f</code> can be rewritten as follows:
</p>

<pre>
(define (f x)
  (assume (exact-integer? x) "f takes integer arguments" x)
  (g (* x x)))
</pre>

<p>
  An optimizing compiler may deduce that <code>x</code> is an exact
  integer after the first expression in the procedure body so may emit
  specialised monomorphic code.  However, in non-debug mode, an
  optimizing compiler may also remove the whole test at the beginning
  of the procedure body because the test has only one branch that does
  not lead into an error situation.
</p>

<p>Another interesting use case is the following, which employs an
assumption that would fail unconditionally:
</p>

<pre>
 (define (foo x a b)
   (case x
    ((plus) (+ a b))
    ((minus) (- a b))
    (else (assume #f "valid operators are plus/minus" x))))
</pre>

<p>
This definition allows a compiler to treat <code>(foo 'times 3 5)</code> as a compile-time error.
</p>

<p>
  One should note that error situations in which implementations are
  not required to signal an error (and the R7RS is full of those and
  this specification adds user defined version on top of that) are
  analogous to what is called <em>undefined behaviour</em>, for
  example, in the C programming language, including its boon and bane.
  In order to reduce a potential source of software bugs, an
  optimizing compiler that makes use of code elimination through
  undefined behaviour should warn the user about dead or meaningless
  code:
</p>

<pre>
(define (f x)
  (unless (exact-integer? x)
    (frob x)
    (assume #f))
  (when (inexact? x)
    (twiddle x))
  (g (* x x)))
</pre>

<p>
Assuming the compiler can prove that <code>(frob x)</code> returns, it
is encouraged issue a warning that the evaluation of <code>frob</code>
is meaningless because the code path in which it appears is invalid.
Likewise, the compiler is encouraged to
issue a warning that <code>(twiddle x)</code> is likewise dead code,
never evaluated.
</p>

<p><i>Note: A program that, for some input, would eventually evaluate
<code>(assume #f)</code> is invalid and execution of it is an error
itself, so anything may happen.  In particular <code>frob</code> may never be
called in the above example.  An optimizing compiler may assume that a program presented to it is
valid, so it may assume that the branch including the call to frob is
never taken. Thus any expression in this path is simply superfluous.</i></p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>
  <code>(assume <em>obj</em> <em>message</em> ...)</code>
</p>

<p>
  This special form is an expression that evaluates to the value
  of <em>obj</em> if <em>obj</em> evaluates to a true value.  It
  is an error if <em>obj</em> evaluates to a false value.  In this case,
  implementations are encouraged to report this error together with
  the <code><em>message</em></code>s to the user, at least when the
  implementation is in debug or non-optimizing mode.  In case of
  reporting the error, an implementation is also encouraged to report
  the source location of the source of the error.
</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>
A simple implementation for R7RS can be given as follows:
</p>

<pre>
(define-library (srfi 145)
  (export assume)
  (import (scheme base))
  (begin
    (define-syntax assume
      (syntax-rules ()
        ((assume expression message ...)
         (unless expression
           (fatal-error "invalid assumption" (quote expression) (list message ...))))
        ((assume . _)
         (syntax-error "invalid assume syntax"))))
  (cond-expand
    (debug
     (begin
       (define fatal-error error)))
    (else
     (begin
       (define (fatal-error message . objs)
         (car 0)))))))
</pre>

<p>
This sample implementation meets all the requirements.  If the feature
identifier <code>debug</code> is set, <code>assume</code> uses
<code>error</code> to signal an invalid assumption.  If the feature
identifier <code>debug</code> is not set,
invoking <code>assume</code> with a false argument causes a subsequent error
when <code>(car 0)</code> is evaluated, thus rendering the whole code
path leading to the invocation of that <code>assume</code> invalid.
</p>

<p>
One should note that there is also a trivial R7RS implementation for
the specification given in this SRFI, namely:
</p>

<pre>
(define-library (srfi 145)
  (export assume)
  (import (scheme base))
  (begin
    (define-syntax assume
      (syntax-rules ()
        ((assume obj . _) obj)))))
</pre>

<p>The reason why this is a faithful implementation is that
whenever <code>(assume #f)</code> is invoked, it is an error anyway,
so that implementations are allowed to fail catastrophically (in the
words of the R7RS), including that they simply return <code>#f</code>.
