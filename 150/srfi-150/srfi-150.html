<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
This SRFI provides a specification and portable implementation of an
extension of the ERR5RS record syntax
of <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-131/srfi-131.html">SRFI
131</a>, where field names inserted by macro transformers are
effectively renamed as if the macro transformer inserted a binding.
This makes this SRFI compatible with the semantics of the record-type
definitions of
the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cowan/r7rs/src/draft-10/rnrs/r7rs.pdf">R7RS</a>
as intended by
its <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scheme-reports-wg2/oKuhgwaM45w/KXgPrh8oAwAJ">authors</a>.
In addition, field names may also be other types of Scheme datums,
like numbers and strings, or
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-88/srfi-88.html">SRFI 88</a> keyword objects.
</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<h2>The problem of hygiene and record-type field names</h2>

<p>
  Consider the following record-type definition in the style
  of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-9/srfi-9.html">SRFI 9:
  Defining Record Types</a>, which was adopted and extended by the
  R7RS:
</p>

<pre>
  (define-record-type &lt;record>
    (make-record field1 field2)
    record?
    (field1 record-field1)
    (field2 record-field2))</pre>

<p>
  Both <code>field1</code> and <code>field2</code> are identifiers.
  The two formal arguments of the constructor <code>make-record</code>
  correspond to the two fields with the same names.
</p>

<p>
  If the above record-type definition results from the output of a
  <code>syntax-rules</code> macro transformer, which in turn may
  result in the hygienic renaming of identifiers, the question arises
  how the identifiers making up the formal arguments of the
  constructor are compared to the identifiers making up the field
  names.
</p>

<p>There are two reasonable answers to this question: Either the
  identifiers are considered raw symbols, in which case they are equal
  if and only if they would denote the same literal if quoted, or they
  are considered bound identifiers in the region of the record-type
  definition, in which case they are equal if and only if a binding
  for one would shadow free references to the other (that is,
  being <code>bound-identifier=?</code> in the terminology of
  the <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/r4rs_12.html#SEC80">appendix
  to the R4RS</a>).  For simplicity, in the sequel, we will call field
  names with the former semantics <em>unhygienic</em> field names, and
  field names with latter semantics <em>hygienic</em> field names.
  (This terminology is meant to be free of any judgement.)
</p>

<p>It is not so clear, however, what the answer to this question is,
  or should be.  SRFI 9 itself does not say much about this.  The
  specification uses the syntax production
  rule <code>&lt;identifier&gt;</code> instead
  of <code>&lt;symbol&gt;</code>, which suggests hygienic matching.
  The sample implementation accompanying SRFI 9, on the other hand,
  does unhygienic matching.  It is, however, only a hack, because of
  the inability of
  the <a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/r5rs.pdf">R5RS</a>
  to create new types.
</p>

<p>It may be more illuminating to inspect a proper implementation of
  this SRFI by its author, Richard Kelsey, which is the implementation of SRFI 9 in
  <a href="http://s48.org/">Scheme 48</a>.  Here, field names are
  hygienic, hinting at the intended meaning of field names.
</p>

<p>There is also another early proper implementation of SRFI 9, namely
  the one found in <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> by
  Mike Sperber from 2001, which also does hygienic matching.
</p>

<p>After the <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/">R6RS</a>, whose record
  system didn't build upon SRFI
  9, <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-99/srfi-99.html">SRFI 99:
    ERR5RS Records</a> was proposed, which extends SRFI 9, amongst
  other things, by a procedural layer.  Although SRFI 99 still speaks
  of field names as <code>&lt;identifier&gt;</code>s
  (versus <code>&lt;symbol&gt;</code>s, which would have made it
  clear), it is clear from the relationship with the accompanying
  procedural interface that field names have to be unhygienic, making
  SRFI 99 incompatible with previous implementations of SRFI 9.
</p>

<p>
  During conception of the R7RS, Working Group 1 decided for inclusion
  of SRFI 9, but decided against inclusion of SRFI 99.  Working Group
  1 was also aware of the question of whether field names should be matched
  hygienically or not, and
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scheme-reports-wg1/lk1ssmvgELs/n1j24HqNp2wJ">arguments
  in favor of hygienic matching</a> were given.
</p>

<p>The resulting document of the R7RS does not explicitly state that
  field names in record-type definitions are matched hygienically.
  However, the terminology wording of the R7RS gives little room for
  another interpretation.  (If someone interpreted the R7RS in such a
  way that field names are unhygienic, by the same reason, pattern
  variables in <code>syntax-rules</code> would be matched
  unhygienically as well &mdash; this is relevant for macros
  producing macro definitions.  However, all implementers and users
  seem to agree that pattern variables are matched hygienically.)
  Alex Shinn, chair of Working Group 1,
  also <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scheme-reports-wg2/oKuhgwaM45w/U5ZFNzT-AgAJ">confirmed
  that field names are hygienic in the R7RS</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, the R7RS is compatible with the original SRFI 9
  implementations, but may break SRFI 99 compatibility when
  record-type definitions result from the output of macro
  transformers.
</p>

<p>
  If the language defined by the R7RS is viewed in isolation, the
  choice made by Working Group 1 resulted in the more powerful
  language.  As the R7RS has only <code>syntax-rules</code> macro, the
  only way for macros to generate new identifiers is through hygienic
  renaming.  Thus, in the R7RS, <code>syntax-rules</code> macros can
  produce record types with an unlimited number of fields
  (making <code>define-record-type</code> truly generative in a second
  sense).  If field names were unhygienic, the following example
  wouldn't work (and would not be realisable
  with <code>syntax-rules</code>, meaning that the various corners of
  the R7RS wouldn't have fit well together):
</p>

<pre>
  (define *counter* -1)

  (define-syntax define-record-type/identity
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((_ rt-name
	(constructor name ...)
	predicate
	id
	field ...)
       (begin
	 (define-record-type rt-name
	   (%constructor %id name ...)
	   predicate
	   (%id id)
	   field ...)
	 (define (constructor . args)
	   (set! *counter* (+ 1 *counter*))
	   (apply %constructor *counter* args))))))</pre>

<p>In fact, even having SRFI 99 at one's disposal, the above problem
  does not have a simple solution.  Using the procedural layer of SRFI
  99, one would have to create a symbol for the identity field
  disjoint from all other field names supplied.  In the absence of
  uninterned symbols, this seems like a deficiency of SRFI 99.
</p>

<h2>The solution proposed by this SRFI</h2>

<p>One reason why SRFI 99 is interesting is that it offers inheritance
  of record types.  A stripped down version of SRFI 99 without the
  procedural layer is SRFI 131.  Being forward-compatible with SRFI
  99, the field names of SRFI 131 are likewise unhygienic, thus being at
  odds with the semantics of the R7RS.
</p>

<p>
  This SRFI proposes to extend the <code>define-record-type</code> of
  the R7RS exactly as it is done by SRFI 131 with three exceptions so
  that compatibility with the R7RS semantics is maintained:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Field names inserted by hygienic macro transformers are
      effectively renamed making the system hygienic and compatible
      with the R7RS as written.  (Strictly speaking, the text of SRFI
      131 also allows an interpretation of field names as identifiers,
      not symbols, but the fact that it says that it is forward
      compatible
      with <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-99/srfi-99.html">SRFI
      99</a> implies that hygiene is stripped from identifiers.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Field names may be identifiers or constants (in the sense of the
      pattern language of 4.3.2 of the R7RS).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from using the field names, one can also use the
    identifiers bound to the accessors by a record-type
    description to refer to fields in the constructors.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The rationale for these additions is as follows:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Hygiene</dt>
  <dd>
    As has been argued above, without
    hygiene, <code>syntax-rules</code>-macro transformers are simply
    not powerful enough to generate sufficient record-type
    definitions.  To give another sample, the following example by Alex Shinn
    would break:
<pre>
 (define-syntax define-tuple-type
   (syntax-rules ()
     ((define-tuple-type name make pred x-ref (defaults ...))
      (deftuple name (make) pred x-ref (defaults ...) (defaults ...) ()))))

 (define-syntax deftuple
   (syntax-rules ()
     ((deftuple name (make args ...) pred x-ref defaults (default . rest)
	(fields ...))
      (deftuple name (make args ... tmp) pred x-ref  defaults rest
	(fields ... (tmp tmp))))
     ((deftuple name (make args ...) pred x-ref (defaults ...) ()
	((field-name get) ...))
      (begin
	(define-record-type name (make-tmp args ...) pred
	  (field-name get) ...)
	(define (make . o)
	  (if (pair? o) (apply make-tmp o) (make-tmp defaults ...)))
	(define x-ref
	  (let ((accessors (vector get ...)))
	    (lambda (x i)
	      ((vector-ref accessors i) x))))))))

 ;; (make-point [first second]) returns a new point
 ;; (point-ref pt <0 or 1>) fetches the first or second field
 (define-tuple-type point make-point point? point-ref (0 0))

 ;; will output (0 0) if field names are matched hygienically
 (let ((pt (make-point)))
   (write (list (point-ref pt 0) (point-ref pt 1)))
   (newline))
 ;; will output (1 2) if field names are matched hygienically
 (let ((pt (make-point 1 2)))
   (write (list (point-ref pt 0) (point-ref pt 1)))
   (newline))
</pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>General field names</dt>
  <dd>As child record-types in this SRFI (as in SRFI 131) refer in
    their constructors to fields of their parent record-type by field
    names (but see below) and the matching of these field names must
    be hygienic as well, the identifier naming the field must either
    be unbound both in the scope of the definition of the parent and
    the child record-type or must share the same binding
    (<em>e.g.</em> as auxiliary syntax) in both scopes.  As this may
    prove to be difficult to ensure when inheritance is to happen
    across library boundaries, field names (of fields that are
    supposed to be part of a public interface) may also be constants
    like strings instead of identifiers.  As strings are not being
    changed due to hygiene, all that is feasible with SRFI 131 is also
    feasible with this SRFI.
</dd>
  <dt>Accessors identifying fields</dt>
  <dd>
    When one needs to stick to hygienic field names (that is
    identifiers as field names) but has to cope with the problems
    mentioned above about matching the field names in child
    record-types, one may also use the identifiers bound to the
    accessors of a record-type definition to refer to field names.  As
    these identifiers are always bound to something meaningful and
    name clashes have to be avoided anyway, matching across library
    boundaries using the identifiers bound to the accessors works
    without any of the problems mentioned above.  (If an identifier names
    both a field and an accessor, the matching of the identifier as a
    field name takes precedence.)
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>One purpose of this SRFI is thus to demonstrate that the power of
  SRFI 131's record types can also be made available on Schemes
  compatible with the hygienic matching of field names of the R7RS,
  and that there is no reason for unhygienic field names (being
  inferior not only when <code>syntax-rules</code> are considered), except
  for SRFI 99 compatibility (which, as stated above, itself broke
  compatibilty with prior implementations).  However, at the end of
  this SRFI, it is outlined how principal compatibility with SRFI 99
  can be achieved if SRFI 99 is suitably extended.
</p>

<p>
  This SRFI can be viewed as a competitor
  to <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-136/srfi-136.html">SRFI
  136</a> by the same author for inclusion in <i>R7RS-large</i>.  Both
  systems emphasize that hygienic field names are possible.  The way
  parent record-type fields are matched in constructor declarations of
  child record-types, however, differs.  While SRFI 136 uses position
  to identify fields (in the spirit of
  the <a href="http://www.r6rs.org">R6RS</a>), this SRFI 150 is more in
  the spirit of the syntax of SRFI 131 (and thus SRFI 99).  (When
  string field names are silently converted to symbols when moving
  from the syntactic to a procedural layer even the interface of SRFI
  99 continues to work with this SRFI.)
</p>

<p>
  Specifying a procedural interface (possibly along the lines of SRFI
  99) as an alternative syntactic interface presented in this SRFI is
  left to a future SRFI when there will have been an agreement on
  whether keyword objects and/or run-time representation
  (<em>e.g.</em> in the form of syntactic closures) of renamed
  identifiers will be included in a future revision of the Scheme
  report.  However, following a suggestion Shiro Kawai, a possible
  procedural interface is outlined below to give implementations a
  hint how a future specification may look like, which should reduce
  the risk of mutually incompatible implementations in the future.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>A Scheme system supporting keyword objects
  through <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-88/srfi-88.html">SRFI 88</a>
  should also allow keywords as field names.  Using keywords instead
  of identifiers, one gets back exactly the semantics of SRFI 131 (and SRFI 99).
</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

This SRFI extends 7.1.6 of R7RS-small as follows:

<pre>
 &lt;definition&gt;
   -&gt; &lt;record-type definition&gt;

 &lt;record type definition&gt;
   -&gt; (define-record-type &lt;type spec&gt;
        &lt;constructor spec&gt;
        &lt;predicate spec&gt;
        &lt;field spec&gt; ...)

 &lt;type spec&gt; -&gt; &lt;type name&gt;
             -&gt; (&lt;type name&gt; &lt;parent&gt;)

 &lt;constructor spec&gt;
              -&gt; #f
              -&gt; &lt;constructor name&gt;
              -&gt; (&lt;constructor name&gt; &lt;field name&gt; ...)

 &lt;predicate spec&gt;
              -&gt; #f
              -&gt; &lt;predicate name&gt;

 &lt;field spec&gt; -&gt; (&lt;field name&gt; &lt;accessor name&gt;)
              -&gt; (&lt;field name&gt; &lt;accessor name&gt; &lt;mutator name&gt;)

 &lt;parent&gt;           -&gt; &lt;type name&gt;
                    -&gt; #f

 &lt;type name&gt;        -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;constructor name&gt; -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;predicate name&gt;   -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;accessor name&gt;    -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;mutator name&gt;     -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;field name&gt;       -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
                    -&gt; &lt;pattern datum&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Semantics</h2>

<p>
  The semantics of a record type definition is the same as in the R7RS
  except for the following additions:
</p>

<p>
  The record-type definition macro-expands into a cluster of definitions that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>binds the <code>&lt;type name&gt;</code> to the record-type
    descriptor for the new record-type (unless the <code>&lt;type
    name&gt;</code> is <code>#f</code>);</li>
  <li>defines a constructor for instances of the new record-type
    (unless the <code>&lt;constructor spec&gt;</code> is <code>#f</code>);</li>
  <li>defines a predicate that recognizes instances of the new
    record-type and its subtypes (unless the <code>&lt;predicate
    spec&gt;</code> is <code>#f</code>);</li>
  <li>defines an accessor for each field name;</li>
  <li>defines a mutator for each mutable field name</li>
</ul>

<p>
A record type definition extends R7RS with the following additional options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If a <code>&lt;parent&gt;</code> datum is specified and
    not <code>#f</code>, then it must be an identifier bound to a
    record-type descriptor that serves as the parent record-type for
    the record-type being defined.  (A
    missing <code>&lt;parent&gt;</code> datum is equivalent
    to <code>#f</code>.)
  </li>
  <li>If <code>#f</code> is specified for the constructor or predicate,
    then no constructor or predicate procedure is defined. (This is
    useful when the record-type being defined will be used as an
    abstract base class and has no immutable fields.)</li>
  <li>If the constructor name is specified as an identifier,
    then the constructor's arguments correspond to the arguments of
    the parent (if any) followed by the new fields added by this
    record-type definition in the specified order.</li>
  <li>Field names may be identifiers or constants (that is strings,
  characters, booleans or numbers).</li>
</ul>

<p>When a constructor spec is of the form <code>(&lt;constructor
    name&gt; &lt;field name&gt; ...)</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each of the <code>&lt;field name&gt;</code>s can either be a
    field name or accessor name declared in the
    same <code>define-record-type</code> form, or any of its
    ancestor's field names or accessor names.  Equality is defined as
    follows: Two constants are considered equal if they are equal in
    the sense of <code>equal?</code>.  An identifier is never
    considered equal to a constant.  Two identifiers appearing in two
    different instances of <code>define-record-type</code> are
    considered equal if and only if they have the same lexical binding
    or the two identifiers are the same (taking renaming due to
    hygiene into account) and both have no lexical binding.  Two
    identifiers appearing in the same instance
    of <code>define-record-type</code> are considered equal if binding
    one identifier would bind the other identifier (in other words:
    both identifiers are the same after renaming due to hygiene).  If
    a field name <code>&lt;field name&gt;</code> is considered equal
    to an identifier naming a field name and an identifier naming an
    accessor, the field name takes precedence.  Field names in
    children shadow field names in parents.
  </li>
  <li>It is an error if the same field is referenced more than once in
    the a constructor spec.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Informative Section</h1>

<p>This section is non-normative but may become normative in
  a future SRFI.
</p>

<h2>Compatibility to the SRFI 99 Procedural Layer</h2>

<p>
  For a Scheme system supporting first class identifiers and first
  class syntactic
  environments and
  the <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-99/srfi-99.html#ProceduralLayer">procedural
  layer of SRFI 99</a> it is recommended that the procedural layer of
  SRFI 99 is extended as described below so that the syntactic layer
  defined by this SRFI can be based upon it:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>
      In the definition of <code>make-rtd</code> in the procedural
      layer of SRFI 99, a field specifier may take one of the following
      forms:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>an identifier naming the field in the style of this SRFI;</li>
      <li>a string, character, boolean, number or keyword
	naming the field in the style of this SRFI;</li>
      <li>a symbol naming the field in the style of SRFI 99 and SRFI 131;</li>
      <li>a list of the form <code>(mutable <em>name</em>)</code>,
      where <em>name</em> is as in 1. &ndash; 3. naming the mutable
	field;</li>
      <li>a list of the form <code>(immutable <em>name</em>)</code>,
	where <em>name</em> is as in 1. &ndash; 3. naming the
	immutable field.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>In the definition of <code>rtd-constructor</code> in the
      procedural layer of SRFI 99, <em>fieldspecs</em> is a vector of
      objects naming fields, where each object is of one of the
      following forms:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>an identifier naming the field in the style of this
	SRFI;</li>
      <li>a string, character, boolean, number, or keyword naming the
	field in the style of this SRFI;</li>
      <li>a symbol naming the field in the style of SRFI 99 and SRFI
	131;</li>
      <li>a procedure returned by <code>rtd-accessor</code> naming the
	field accessor (and thus the field itself) in the style of this SRFI.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><p>
      In the definitions of <code>rtd-accessor</code>
      and <code>rtd-mutator</code>, <em>field</em> is an object of
      one the following forms:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>an identifier naming the field in the style of this
	SRFI;</li>
      <li>a string, character, boolean, number, or keyword naming the
	field in the style of this SRFI;</li>
      <li>a symbol naming the field in the style of SRFI 99 and SRFI
	131;</li>
      <li>a procedure returned by <code>rtd-accessor</code> naming the
	field accessor (and thus the field itself) in the style of this SRFI.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      An implementation may restrict <code>rtd-accessor</code> to return always the same
      accessor procedure per field in order to make the naming of field
      accessors as used by the procedural layer described here
      unambiguous.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>


<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>
The <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-150/srfi-150.tgz">sample implementation</a> builds
on <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-137/srfi-137.html">SRFI
137</a> to provide unique types.  The syntax is implemented
using <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-148/srfi-148.html">SRFI
148</a>, whose sample implementation relies
on <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-147/srfi-147.html">SRFI
  147</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The implementation also serves as a demonstration for the succinct
  style of the macro system of SRFI 148 (for comparison, take a look
  at the source of SRFI 131 or SRFI 136).

<p>The <code>define-record-type</code> identifier exported by the
  library <code>(srfi 150)</code> of the sample implementation is not
  bound to the same syntactic keyword,
  the <code>define-record-type</code>-identifier exported by the core
  library <code>(scheme base)</code>.  This is because the base
  library cannot be portably redefined.

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>Credit goes to all members of the Scheme Working Group 2, who
participated in the discussion of record types in R7RS-large.  Quite a
lot of wording was copied verbatim from SRFI 131 (and SRFI 136).
</p>

<p>Credit also goes to Alex Shinn for setting up a
<a href="http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/wiki/RecordFieldNameHygiene">summary</a>
parts of the discussion.
</p>

<p>I would also like to thank Shiro Kawai for suggesting to include
  the informal section of compatibility with the SRFI 99 procedural
  layer.
