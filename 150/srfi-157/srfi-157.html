    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>
      Continuation marks are a programming language feature that
      allows one to attach information to and retrieve information
      from continuations, generalizing stack inspection.
      Conceptually, a continuation consists of a number of frames
      where each frame stands for an active procedure call that is not
      a tail call.  A continuation mark is then a key-value pair
      associated with a frame, with keys compared
      using <code>eq?</code>.
      At most one mark for a given key can be attached to a single frame.
    </p>

    <p>
      Besides stack inspection, continuation marks can be used to
      implement dynamic scope, delimited continuations, or delayed
      evaluation that is able to handle iterative lazy algorithms.
    </p>

    <p>
      This SRFI proposes to add continuation marks to the Scheme
      programming language.  The interface defined here is modelled
      after Racket's continuation marks.  It does not include all
      forms and procedures provided by Racket but provides a
      compatible subset.
    </p>

    <h1>Rationale</h1>

    <p>One of the defining properties of the Scheme programming
      language is that it is <em>properly tail-recursive</em>.  The R7RS defines
      that <q>an implementation is properly tail-recursive if it
	supports an unbounded number of active tail calls</q>, and goes on
      to define which procedure calls occur in <em>tail context</em>
      (see <a href="http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/wiki/R7RSHomePage">R7RS, section 3.5</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Being properly tail-recursive or, for a procedure call, to occur
      in tail context with respect to a lambda expression, is,
      however, a non-observable property.  A non-properly tail
      recursive implementation of Scheme may be observably
      indistinguishable from a proper implementation as long as
      storage space is sufficient.  (This is the same argument which is used
      in the implementation section
      of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-124/srfi-124.html">SRFI
	124</a>, where it is argued that there are no guarantees that
      a garbage collection is run at all, or even exists.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Continuation marks are a programming language feature that, in
      particular, reifies the notion of proper tail calls.  More
      generally, continuation marks allow one to attach values to the
      control stack (or, in Scheme terms, to the current
      continuation), and to retrieve these values later, and in such a
      way that it does not interfere with Scheme's tail-calling requirement.
    </p>

    <p>Continuation marks can be used to implement stack inspection
      useful for debuggers.  They can also be used to implement dynamic
      scope in the form of parameter objects as in the R7RS.  Whereas
      the reference implementation in the R7RS, which relies
      on <code>dynamic-wind</code> instead, does not have the
      desirable feature that the last expression within the body of
      a <code>parameterize</code> expression occurs in tail context, a
      simple implementation using continuation marks having this
      feature is possible.  Another use case of continuation marks is
      the proper implementation of delayed evaluation in a strict
      programming language that allows for iterative lazy algorithms
      without the need of the special <code>delay-force</code> form of
      the R7RS; see <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-155/srfi-155.html">SRFI
	155: Promises</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>Examples</h1>

    <p>In order to demonstrate the application range of continuations
      and in order to introduce the syntactic forms and procedures
      defined by this SRFI below, we start with a number of examples.
    </p>

    <h2>Some simple examples</h2>

    <p>
      Continuation marks can be attached with
      <code>with-continuation-mark</code> and retrieved
      with <code>current-continuation-marks</code> and the
      accessors <code>continuation-mark-set->list</code>, <code>continuation-mark-set->list*</code>
      and <code>continuation-mark-set-first</code>.
    </p>

    <pre>
  (let ((key (vector 'key)))
    (with-continuation-mark key 1
      (continuation-mark-set-&gt;list (current-continuation-marks) key))) ; ⇒  (1)</pre>

    <pre>
  (let ((key (vector 'key)))
    (with-continuation-mark key 1
      (cons 'foo
        (with-continuation-mark key 2
          (continuation-mark-set-&gt;list (current-continuation-marks) key))))) ; ⇒ (foo 2 1)</pre>

    <p>
      We use the invocation of <code>cons</code> to ensure that the
      inner <code>with-continuation-mark</code> form does not occur in
      tail context with respect to the outer <code>with-continuation-mark</code> form.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without, we would get:
    </p>

    <pre>
  (let ((key (vector 'key)))
    (with-continuation-mark key 1
      (with-continuation-mark key 2
        (continuation-mark-set-&gt;list (current-continuation-marks) key)))) ; ⇒ (2)</pre>

    <h2>Recursive versus iterative algorithms</h2>

    <p>Consider the following two definitions of a factorial procedure:</p>

    <pre>
  (define (fact1 n)
    (let loop ((n n))
      (if (zero? n)
          1
          (* n (loop (- n 1))))))

  (define (fact2 n)
    (let loop ((n n) (a 1))
      (if (zero? n)
          a
          (loop (- n 1) (* n a)))))</pre>

    <p>The first version is recursive.  The second version is iterative.
      Using continuation marks, we can observe this behaviour:
    </p>

    <pre>
  (define %key (vector 'key))

  (define (ccm)
    (continuation-mark-set-&gt;list (current-continuation-marks) %key))

  (define (fact1 n)
    (let loop ((n n))
      (if (zero? n)
          (begin
            (display (ccm))
            (newline)
            1)
          (with-continuation-mark %key n (* n (loop (- n 1)))))))

  (define (fact2 n)
    (let loop ((n n) (a 1))
      (if (zero? n)
          (begin
            (display (ccm))
            (newline)
            a)
          (with-continuation-mark %key n (loop (- n 1) (* n a))))))</pre>

    <p>Calling <code>(fact1 3)</code> outputs <code>(1 2 3)</code> on
    the console, while calling <code>(fact2 3)</code>
    outputs <code>(1)</code> on the console.
    </p>

    <h2>Parameter objects</h2>

    <p>
      A version of <code>parameterize</code>, in which the last
      expression of its body is in tail context, and which is thus
      usable for iterative algorithms and thus in the spirit of the
      Scheme programming language, can be obtained using
      continuation marks as follows:
    </p>

    <pre>
  (define %param-key (vector 'param-key))
  (define %param-convert (vector 'param-convert))

  (define make-parameter
    (case-lambda
      ((init)
       (make-parameter init values))
      ((init converter)
       (let ((key (vector 'key))
             (value (converter init)))
         (case-lambda
           (()
            (let ((boxed-value (continuation-mark-set-first (current-continuation-marks)
                                                             key)))
             (if boxed-value
                 (vector-ref boxed-value 0)
                 value)))
           ((secret)
            (cond
              ((eq? %param-convert secret)
               converter)
              ((eq? %param-key secret)
               key))))))))

  (define-syntax parameterize
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((parameterize
           ((param init) ...) . body)
       (%parameterize ((param init) ...) () body))))

  (define-syntax %parameterize
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((_ () ((param init tmp) ...) body)
       (let* ((tmp ((param %param-convert) init)) ...)
         (%parameterize ((param tmp) ...) body)))
      ((_ ((param1 init1) . rest) ((param2 init2 tmp2) ...) body)
       (%parameterize rest ((param2 init2 tmp2) ... (param1 init1 tmp1)) body))
      ((%parameterize () body)
       (let () . body))
      ((%parameterize ((param tmp) . rest) body)
       (with-continuation-mark (param %param-key) (vector tmp)
         (%parameterize rest body)))))</pre>

    <h2>Test for tail position</h2>

    <p>Some Scheme procedures are required to call certain procedures
      in tail position, and some Scheme forms are required to have
      certain expressions in tail context.
    </p>

    <p>
      With only the primitives as defined by the R7RS, unit tests
      (using
      the <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-64/srfi-64.html">SRFI
	64</a> framework, for example) cannot check whether procedure
      calls actually happen in tail position.  With continuation
      marks, it is possible to implement such tests.
    </p>

    <pre>
  (define-syntax test-tail-position
    (syntax-rules
      ((test-tail-position tail expression)
       (test-assert
         (call-with-current-continuation
          (lambda (c)
            (let ((key (vector 'key)))
              (let-syntax
                  ((tail
                   (syntax-rules ()
                     ((tail) (lambda args
                               (call-with-immediate-continuation-mark key c))))))
                (with-continuation-mark key #t expression)
              #f))))))))

  (test-tail-position tail
    (apply (tail) 1 2))</pre>

    <p>The last test should succeed for a correct implementation
      of <code>apply</code>.</p>

    <p><i>Note: </i> Using the syntax parameters
	of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-139/srfi-139.html">SRFI
        139</a> and defining <code>tail</code> as a syntax parameter would
        eliminate the need for the unpleasant passing of the <code>tail</code>
        datum to the <code>test-tail-position</code> macro.</p>

    <h1>Specification</h1>

    <h2>Continuation marks</h2>

    <p>
      We view a continuation as a list of frames where each frame
      represents an active procedure call that is not a tail call.
      Each non-tail call of a procedure adds a frame to the head of the
      list of frames of the current continuation, while tail-calling a
      procedure conceptually reuses the top (or first) frame.
    </p>

    <p>
      Continuation marks associate values to keys to frames.  There
      can be at most one value for a given frame and key.  Keys and
      values can be arbitrary Scheme objects.  Keys are compared
      using <code>eq?</code>.

    <p>
      The continuation marks for a given key in a continuation
      conceptually form a list of all values associated with the given
      key in the frames of the continuation, ordered by the ordering
      of frames.
    </p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <p>
      An R7RS system that supports this SRFI shall make the identifiers
      defined below available in the <code>(srfi 157)</code> library.
    </p>

    <p>
      On any such system, the last expression within the body of
      a <code>parameterize</code> expression shall occur in a tail context.
    </p>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>

    <p><code>(with-continuation-mark &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;
	&lt;expression&gt;)</code></p>

    <p>The <code>&lt;key&gt;</code> expression is evaluated to obtain
      a key, the <code>&lt;value&gt;</code> expression is evaluated to
      obtain a value, the key is mapped to the value as a continuation
      mark in the current continuation's initial continuation (if the
      frame already has a mark for the key, the mark is replaced), and,
      finally, the <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> is evaluated.  The
      continuation for evaluating <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> is the
      continuation of the <code>with-continuation-mark</code> expression
      (so the result of the <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> is the
      result of the <code>with-continuation-mark</code> expression, and
      the <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> is in tail context if
      the <code>with-continuation-mark</code> expression is).
    </p>

    <h2>Procedures</h2>

    <p>In the descriptions of the following
    procedures, <code><em>default</em></code> stands for an optional
    argument that defaults to <code>#f</code> if it is not provided.</p>

    <p><code>(current-continuation-marks)</code></p>

    <p>
      Returns an object called a <em>set of continuations
	marks</em>, which at some point in the future can be asked (by
      the <code>continuation-mark-set-&gt;list</code>,
      <code>continuation-mark-set-&gt;list*</code>
      and <code>continuation-mark-set-first</code> procedures) to
      deliver the set of continuation marks of the continuation of the
      call to <code>current-continuation-marks</code> for a given key.
    </p>

    <p><code>(continuation-marks? <em>obj</em>)</code></p>

    <p>
      Returns <code>#t</code> if <code><em>obj</em></code> is a set
      of continuation marks, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.  Note that
      sets of continuation marks are not necessarily disjoint from other
      Scheme types such as lists.
    </p>

    <p><code>(continuation-mark-set-&gt;list <em>marks</em> <em>key</em>)</code></p>

    <p>Returns a newly allocated list containing the marks for
      the <code><em>key</em></code> in the continuation mark
      set <code><em>marks</em></code>.
    </p>

    <p><code>(continuation-mark-set-&gt;list* <em>marks</em> <em>list</em>)</code></p>
    <p><code>(continuation-mark-set-&gt;list* <em>marks</em> <em>list</em> <em>default</em>)</code></p>

    <p>Returns a newly allocated list containing vectors of marks in
    the continuation mark set <code><em>marks</em></code>.  The length
    of each vector in the result list is the same as the length of the
    key <code><em>list</em></code>, and a value in a particular vector
    position is the value for the corresponding key
    in <code><em>list</em></code>.  Values for multiple keys appear in
    a single vector only when the marks are for the same continuation
    frame in the continuation mark set <code><em>marks</em></code>.
    The object <code><em>default</em></code> is used for vector elements to indicate
      the lack of a value.
    </p>

    <p><code>(continuation-mark-set-first <em>marks</em> <em>key</em>)</code></p>
    <p><code>(continuation-mark-set-first <em>marks</em> <em>key</em> <em>default</em>)</code></p>

    <p>
      Returns the first element of the list that would be returned
      by <code>(continuation-mark-set-&gt;list <em>marks</em> <em>key</em>)</code>,
      or <code><em>default</em></code> if the result would be the empty list.
    </p>

    <p>
      Semantically equivalent to, but may be more efficient than:
    </p>

    <pre>
  (let ((lst (continuation-mark-set-&gt;list <em>marks</em> <em>key</em>))
    (if (not (null? lst))
        (car lst)
        default)))</pre>

    <p><code>(call-with-immediate-continuation-mark <em>key</em> <em>proc</em>)</code></p>
    <p><code>(call-with-immediate-continuation-mark <em>key</em> <em>proc</em>
    <em>default</em>)</code></p>

    <p>
      Tail-calls <code><em>proc</em></code> with the value associated
      with <code><em>key</em></code> in the first frame of the current
      continuation (<i>i.e.</i>, a value that would be replaced in the
      set of current continuation marks if the call
      to <code>call-with-immediate-continuation-mark</code> were
      replaced with a <code>with-continuation-mark</code> form
      using <code><em>key</em></code> as the key expression).  If no
      such value exists in the first frame, <code><em>default</em></code> is passed
      to <code><em>proc</em></code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Semantically equivalent to, but may be more efficient than:
    </p>

    <pre>
  (let ((secret-key (vector #f)))
    (with-continuation-mark secret-key #f
      (let ((marks
            (continuation-mark-set-&gt;list* (current-continuation-marks)
                                          (list <em>key</em> secret-key)
                                          <em>default</em>))
        (<em>proc</em> (vector-ref (car marks) 0)))))</pre>

    <h1>Implementation</h1>

    <p>
      An implementation of continuation marks as a portable R7RS library is not
      possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      This SRFI provides an <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-157/srfi-157.tgz">implementation</a> in
      the form of a meta-circular interpreter written in R7RS
      dubbed <em>Inferior Scheme</em>.  Inferior Scheme is a REPL for
      the Scheme IEEE 1178-1990 standard.  Outside of the standard
      syntax and procedures, Inferior Scheme provides the syntax and
      the procedures of this SRFI, and the <code>load</code> procedure
      of the R4RS.
    </p>

    <p>
      A mature implementation of continuation marks is available
      in <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>.
    </p>

	Scheme</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/chibi-scheme/0V33GBeglkE/n6HVKOWCBgAJ">expressed plans to support continuation marks in his implementation</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Implementation hints</h2>

    <p>
      A simple way for an implementation of Scheme to provide
      continuation marks is to pass two implicit parameters
      called <em>flag</em> and <em>marks</em> in each call.  The
      parameter <em>flag</em> is <code>#t</code> in a call if the call
      is a tail call that occurs in tail context with respect to the
      form <code>with-continuation-mark</code>, and <code>#f</code>
      otherwise.  The parameter <em>marks</em> holds the current
      continuation marks.  The Inferior Scheme implementation bundled
      with this SRFI uses this approach.  It is detailed in
      R. Germane's master's thesis (see acknowledgements).
    </p>

    <p>
      An implementation of Scheme that employs a global CPS-transform
      to model continuations can implement continuation marks more
      efficiently as follows: The current continuation marks are
      stored in a thread-local mutable cell, which corresponds to the
      implicit <em>marks</em> parameter from above.  The
      form <code>with-continuation-marks</code> invokes
      its <em>expression</em> with a specific special
      continuation procedure <em>C*</em>.  The presence of that
      specific continuation procedure as the current continuation
      corresponds to the <em>flag</em> parameter from above
      being <code>#t</code>.  (In order for
      the <code>with-continuation-marks</code> form to be able to
      return to its continuation, it has to push its continuation onto
      the current continuation marks so that <em>C*</em> can access it
      when it is invoked and pass control to it.)
    </p>

    <p>
      A similar strategy is possible for Scheme implementations that
      are stack-based.  Passing the special continuation procedure
      from above is replaced by leaving a specific special return
      value on the stack.
