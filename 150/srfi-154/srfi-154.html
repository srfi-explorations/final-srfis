    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    Scheme has the notion of the <em>dynamic extent</em> of a
    procedure call.  A number of standard Scheme procedures and
    syntaxes
    like <code>dynamic-wind</code>, <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>,
    and <code>parameterize</code> deal with the dynamic extent
    indirectly.  The same holds true for the procedures and syntaxes
    dealing with continuation marks as defined
    by <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-157/srfi-157.html">SRFI
    157</a>.

    This SRFI reifies the dynamic extent into a first-class value
    together with a well-defined procedural interface and a syntax to
    create procedures that remember not only their environment at
    creation time but also their dynamic extent, which includes their
    dynamic environment.

    <h1>Rationale</h1>

    <p>
      While the Scheme language is rich enough to reify the concept of
      the dynamic extent of a procedure
      &mdash; the sample implementation accompanying this SRFI is a
      proof of this fact &mdash; there is no standard for how such a
      reification is exposed to the user.  It is the purpose of this
      SRFI to remedy this.  In particular, Scheme systems may provide
      faster implementations than the portable sample implementation
      of this SRFI.
    </p>

    <p>
      To give an example why explicit handling of dynamic extents
      can become necessary, let us consider the following two definitions:
    </p>

    <pre>
  (define (safe-sqrt error-handler)
    (lambda (x)
      (when (negative? x)
        (error-handler "negative argument"))
      (sqrt x)))

  (define (error-handler msg)
    (display msg (current-error-port))
    (newline (current-error-port))
    'error)

  (define my-safe-sqrt (safe-sqrt error-handler))
    </pre>

    <p>
      When <code>(my-safe-sqrt -1)</code> is executed, an error
      message is printed on the current error port of the call
      to <code>my-safe-sqrt</code>.  It may, however, have been the
      intention of the user that the message is printed to whatever
      error port was current when the
      procedure <code>error-handler</code> was defined.  Using the
      syntax of this SRFI, this can be achieved by changing the
      definition of <code>errror-handler</code> into:
    </p>

    <pre>
  (define error-handler
    (dynamic-lambda (msg)
      (display msg (current-error-port))
      (newline (current-error-port))
      'error))
    </pre>

    <p>
      The same goes not only for error handlers, but for any other
      type of callback procedure where it often makes sense to
      reinstate the dynamic extent of the definition of the
      callback for the dynamic extent of the call to the
      callback, <i>e.g.</i> to define the callback
      using <code>dynamic-lambda</code> as opposed to using a
      bare <code>lambda</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In case the error handler from the example above wants to call
      back on a provided continuation, we have to be a bit more
      careful so that the continuation is called in the expected
      dynamic extent:
    </p>

    <pre>
  (define (safe-sqrt error-handler)
    (lambda (x)
      (when (negative? x)
        (error-handler "negative argument" exit))
      (sqrt x)))

  (define error-handler
    (let ((dynamic-extent (current-dynamic-extent)))
      (lambda (msg exit)
        (with-dynamic-extent dynamic-extent
         (lambda ()
           (display msg (current-error-port))
           (newline (current-error-port))))
        (exit 'error))))

  (define my-safe-sqrt (safe-sqrt error-handler))
    </pre>

    <p>Note that the example of the error handler above is meant as a
      minimal example in order to demonstrate the capabilities of this
      library.  It is not an example that cannot easily be rewritten
      in Scheme code not making use of this SRFI, <i>e.g.</i> by
      taking a snapshot of the value
      of <code>current-error-port</code> in form of a lexical
      variable.  However, note that in general more than one parameter
      object may be accessed in the dynamic extent of the body of
      the <code>dynamic-lambda</code> or that they are not necessarily
      known.  In the presence
      of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-39/srfi-39.html">SRFI
      39</a> parameter objects, which are mutable, the technique of
      taking a snapshot of the current value won't work.  Finally, the
      dynamic extent can be much more complicated than just about
      parameter objects. For example, there could be global state that
      is set up and restored by <code>dynamic-wind</code>.  In all
      these cases, this SRFI provides the cleanest solution.
    </p>

    <p>Another use case
      is <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-155/srfi-155.html">SRFI
      155</a>, which provides a specification and an implementation of
      promises such that lazy algorithms using them work well in the presence
      of <code>call-with-current-continuation</code> and dynamically
      scoped variables.
    </p>

    <h1>Specification</h1>

    <p>
      Throughout, we reuse the term <em>dynamic extent</em> for a reified
      dynamic extent.  In this sense, the <code><em>before</em></code>
      thunk of a call to <code>dynamic-wind</code>
      sets up the dynamic extent of the call
      to <code><em>thunk</em></code>, while
      the <code><em>after</em></code> thunk restores the dynamic
      extent of the call to <code>dynamic-wind</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dynamic extents form a type not necessarily disjoint from
      other Scheme types.
    </p>

    <p>An R7RS system implementing this SRFI shall export the
      following procedures and the syntax under the library
      name <code>(srfi 154)</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Procedures</h2>

    <p><code>(dynamic-extent? <em>obj</em></code>)</p>

    <p>
      The <code>dynamic-extent?</code> procedure
      returns <code>#t</code> if its argument is a dynamic extent,
      and <code>#f</code> otherwise.  Note that dynamic extents are not
      necessarily disjoint from other Scheme types such as procedures.
    </p>

    <p><code>(current-dynamic-extent)</code></p>

    <p>
      The <code>current-dynamic-extent</code> procedure returns
      the current dynamic extent by capturing the dynamic extent
      of the call to <code>current-dynamic-extent</code>, which
      can be reinstated by the
      procedure <code>with-dynamic-extent</code>.
    </p>

    <p><code>(with-dynamic-extent <em>dynamic-extent</em> <em>thunk</em>)</code></p>

    <p>
      The <code>with-dynamic-extent</code> procedure calls
      the <code><em>thunk</em></code> and returns the values yielded
      by <code><em>thunk</em></code>.  The call
      to <code><em>thunk</em></code> happens in the dynamic extent
      captured by the <code><em>dynamic-extent</em></code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>

    <p><code>(dynamic-lambda &lt;formals&gt; &lt;body&gt;)</code></p>

    <p>A <code>dynamic-lambda</code> expression is equivalent
      to <code>lambda</code> expression except that not only the
      environment but also the dynamic extent in effect when the
      <code>dynamic-lambda</code> expression was evaluated is
      remembered.

      In other words, the expression <code>(dynamic-lambda
      &lt;formals&gt; &lt;body&gt;)</code> closes also over the
      dynamic extent.
    </p>

    <h1>Addendum to SRFI 157</h1>

    <p>Any Scheme system implementing both SRFI 154 and SRFI 157 shall
      also define the following procedures.
    </p>

    <p>An R7RS system shall export these procedures under
      the <code>(srfi 157 key)</code> library name.</p>

    <p><i>Note: It also makes sense for a Scheme system that only
	implements the continuation marks of SRFI 157 and not the
	first-class dynamic extents described in this document to
	implement the following procedures.</i></p>

    <p><code>(make-continuation-mark-key)</code></p>

    <p>The <code>make-continuation-mark-key</code> procedure returns
      an object that can be used as a key for continuation marks.  The
      returned object is guaranteed to be different (in the sense
      of <code>eq?</code>) from any other existing Scheme object
      including other Scheme objects returned by previous or future
      invocations of <code>make-continuation-mark-key</code>.
    </p>

    <p><code>(continuation-mark-key? <em>obj</em>)</code></p>

    <p>The <code>continuation-mark-key?</code> procedure
    returns <code>#t</code> if <code><em>obj</em></code> is a Scheme
    object that was returned by a previous invocation
    of <code>make-continuation-mark-key</code>, and <code>#f</code>,
      otherwise.
    </p>

    <p><i>Rationale: Continuation marks can associate values with
	arbitrary keys, not just keys created
	by <code>make-continuation-mark-key</code>.  However,
	continuation marks associated with keys created
	by <code>make-continuation-mark-key</code> can be more
	efficient because the implementation is free to store
	arbitrary metadata inside the key, which it can use to
	implement continuation marks associated with these keys more
	efficiently.

	Therefore, it is generally recommended to use continuation
	marks with these keys.
    </i></p>

    <p><code>(make-continuation-mark-shallow-key)</code></p>

    <p>The <code>make-continuation-mark-shallow-key</code> procedure
      returns an object that can be used as a key for continuation
      marks, called a <em>shallow key</em>.  The returned object is guaranteed to be different (in
      the sense of <code>eq?</code>) from any other existing Scheme
      object including other Scheme objects returned by previous or
      future invocations of <code>make-continuation-mark-shallow-key</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The set of continuation marks returned by the
      procedure <code>(current-continuation-marks)</code> (originally
      defined in SRFI 157) retains not the full list of all
      continuation mark values associated with a shallow key but this
      list truncated after the first element.  (For any other type of
      key, the set of continuation marks contains the full list of all
      continuation mark values.)
    </p>

    <p><code>(continuation-mark-shallow-key? <em>obj</em>)</code></p>

    <p>The <code>continuation-mark-shallow-key?</code> procedure
      returns <code>#t</code> if <code><em>obj</em></code> is a Scheme
      object that was returned by a previous invocation
      of <code>make-continuation-mark-shallow-key</code>, and <code>#f</code>,
      otherwise.
    </p>

    <p><i>Rationale: Often, user code is only interested in the latest
	continuation mark value associated with a key, that is the
	procedure <code>continuation-mark-set-first</code> instead
	of <code>continuation-mark-set->list</code> is used.
	(The implementation of parameter objects in SRFI 157 is an
	example.)  In conjunction with the first-class dynamic extents
	of this SRFI, this can lead to space leaks
	because <code>current-dynamic-extent</code> generally has to
	capture all continuation mark values and not only the latest.
	For continuation marks associated with shallow keys,
	however, <code>current-dynamic-extent</code> only needs to
	retain the latest values.
    </i></p>

    <h1>Implementation</h1>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-154/srfi-154.tgz">sample implementation</a> is provided
      as an R7RS library.  It should be easily adaptable to any Scheme
      implementation as long as that implementation has a concept of
      dynamic extents,
      provides <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>, and has a
      macro facility (for implementing <code>dynamic-lambda</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
      The sample implementation includes a special algorithm for use
      with Chibi Scheme.  This serves as a demonstration how efficient
      implementations of this specification can be provided by Scheme
      implementers.
    </p>

    <p>
      A full implementation of this specification (including an
      implementation of SRFI 157 and its extension described here) is
      provided in the form of a meta-circular interpreter written in
      R7RS dubbed <a href="https://gitlab.com/nieper/inferior-scheme/">Inferior Scheme</a>,
      which is a REPL for the Scheme IEEE 1178-1990 standard. Outside
      of the standard syntax and procedures, Inferior Scheme provides
      the syntax and the procedures of SRFIs 154, 155, and 157, the <code>load</code>
      procedure of the R4RS, <code>dynamic-wind</code> of R5RS,
      and <code>parameterize</code> and <code>make-parameter</code> of
      R7RS.
    </p>

    <p>Thanks go to the SRFI editor for keeping the SRFI process alive
      and running.

      Special thanks go to Jim Rees for playing with and testing this
      proposed specification.  Fruitful discussions with him led to
      the definition of shallow keys to prevent space leaks in SRFI
      155 and other use cases.
