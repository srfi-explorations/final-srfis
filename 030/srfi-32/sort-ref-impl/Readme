This is the preliminary reference-implementation code for the sorting
package currently under discussion as SRFI-32. 
  - I am not interested in hearing about any style or compatibility
    issues, yet. I have not finished polishing this code for release;
    it does not yet meet my coding standards.
  - I am interested in hearing about actual bugs. I *have* run the code 
    through the automatic test harness in test.scm, so most of the low-hanging
    fruit has been collected.
  - I *do not* recommend taking this code and using it. Wait a few weeks,
    until the SRFI is finalised; let's avoid having random preliminary copies
    of the code propagating around the net.
  - The code that particularly needs a polishing pass is lmsort.scm and 
    vmsort.scm, the natural merge sorts.
