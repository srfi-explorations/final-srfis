<H1>Abstract</H1>

<p> This SRFI specifies an extremely simple facility for making an extension
or library available to a Scheme toplevel environment.

<H1>Rationale</H1>

<p> The <tt>(requires ...)</tt> clause of SRFI 7 (<i>Feature-based
program configuration language</i>) is one possible way for a program to
declare that it requires certain features or extensions in order to run.
There are two limitations with this facility: first, an implementation
of SRFI 7 is not actually required to do anything as the result of
encountering a <tt>(requires ...)</tt> clause.  At the time of this
writing, some implementations do in fact load and make available the
specified extension in this case, but some do not.  Second, the SRFI 7
language is most appropriate as an annotation to program text.  It is
not designed for interactive use.</p>

<p> This SRFI therefore defines a simple mechanism specifically for
requiring that extensions be made immediately available to subsequent
code at compile-time or runtime, as appropriate.  In particular, the
intent is that a trivial, portable means exist for loading SRFI
functionality within a program or interactive session; but the mechanism
described here is general enough to be used for other types of
extensions, at the implementation's discretion.</p>

<p>Most implementations of Scheme include a form very similar to
<tt>require-extension</tt>.  This SRFI can therefore be viewed, in the
context of those Schemes, as merely a standard naming convention.</p>

<p>It is possible for an implementation's design, contrary to common
practice, to conflict with the semantics of
<tt>require-extension</tt>. Such an implementation would provide an
alternative means of specifying requirements. This SRFI does not aim to be
ubiquitous, only to capture current idiom.</p>


<H1>Specification</H1>

<p> The <tt>require-extension</tt> form is used to make an extension
available in the toplevel scope in which it appears.  The definition of
a "toplevel scope" and the exact meaning of what it means to make an
extension available in one is implementation-defined, but we expect
likely scopes will include the default scope in which program
expressions are evaluated; the scope in which program expressions within
a module are evaluated, as defined by a module system; and the
interactive REPL ("read-eval-print loop"). 
When <tt>require-extension</tt> is used to make an
extension available in a non-interactive context, it is
implementation-defined whether the extension will be available to code
lexically preceding the <tt>require-extension</tt> form in the same
scope, but it should be available to code in the same scope lexically
succeeding the <tt>require-extension</tt> form.  An implementation
should default to signalling a warning or an error in the event that a
requested extension cannot be made available. An implementation is encouraged 
but not required to signal a warning or an error if the user attempts
to access incompatible extensions simultaneously.

</p><p> An implementation claiming to support this SRFI must support
<tt>require-extension</tt> in at least one scope.

</p><p> The syntax of <tt>require-extension</tt> is as follows:

</p><p> <tt>(require-extension &lt;clause&gt; ...)</tt>

</p><p> A clause has the form:

</p><p> <tt>(&lt;extension-identifier&gt; &lt;extension-argument&gt; ...)</tt>

</p><p> where <tt>&lt;extension-identifier&gt;</tt> is a symbol and the zero or
more <tt>&lt;extension-argument&gt;</tt>s may be any Scheme values.

</p><p> This SRFI defines only one <tt>extension-identifier</tt>, the identifier
<tt>srfi</tt>, which implementations purporting to conform to this SRFI must
support.  The <tt>extension-argument</tt>s of a <tt>srfi</tt> clause may be
any Scheme values, at an implementation's discretion, but an implementation
must support nonnegative integer <tt>extension-argument</tt>s and should
treat them as a directive to make the functionality of the indicated SRFIs
available in the context in which the <tt>require-extension</tt> form
appears.  For example:

</p><pre>(require-extension (srfi 1))              ; Make the SRFI 1 List Library available
(require-extension (srfi 1 13 14))        ; Make the SRFI 1, 13 and 14 libraries available
</pre>

<H1>Implementation</H1>

<p> The implementation of <tt>require-extension</tt> is necessarily
implementation-specific. 
<br>Here is a (very simple) example implementation
that is based on the optional 
<a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-9.html#%_sec_6.6.4">R5RS</a>
<tt>load</tt> procedure:

</p><pre>;;;; Reference implementation for SRFI-55
;
; Requirements: SRFI-23 (error reporting)

(define available-extensions '())

(define (register-extension id action . compare)
  (set! available-extensions
    (cons (list (if (pair? compare) (car compare) equal?)
		id 
		action)
	  available-extensions)) )

(define (find-extension id)
  (define (lookup exts)
    (if (null? exts)
	(error "extension not found - please contact your vendor" id)
	(let ((ext (car exts)))
	  (if ((car ext) (cadr ext) id)
	      ((caddr ext))
	      (lookup (cdr exts)) ) ) ) )
  (lookup available-extensions) )

(define-syntax require-extension 
  (syntax-rules (srfi)
    ((_ "internal" (srfi id ...))
     (begin (find-extension '(srfi id) ...)) )
    ((_ "internal" id)
     (find-extension 'id) )
    ((_ clause ...)
     (begin (require-extension "internal" clause) ...)) ) )

; Example of registering extensions:
;
;   (register-extension '(srfi 1) (lambda () (load "/usr/local/lib/scheme/srfi-1.scm")))
