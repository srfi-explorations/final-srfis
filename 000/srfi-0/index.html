    <h2>Abstract</h2>      <p>It is desirable that programs which depend on
      additions to standard Scheme name those additions. SRFIs provide the
      specifications of these additions ("features"), and SRFI 0 provides the
      means to actually check that these features are present in the Scheme
      system by means of the <code>cond-expand</code> construct. It is
      anticipated that there will be two main classes of features:
      <ul>
        <li>sets of value and syntax bindings
        <li>reader syntax extensions
      </ul>
      <p>("Reader syntax" refers to aspects of the
      syntax described by the grammars in the Scheme reports.)
      <p>The former class of features will probably
      include most SRFIs, exemplified by the list library specified in <a href=
      "/srfi-1/">SRFI 1</a>. The latter class includes Unicode source code
      support and different kinds of parentheses.
      <p>Control over the presence of individual
      features will vary over different Scheme systems. A given feature may be
      absent or provided by default in some Scheme systems and in others some
      mechanism (such as an "import" clause in the code or a program
      configuration file, a command line option, a dependency declaration in a
      module definition, etc.) will be required for the feature to be present
      in the system.
      <p>Moreover, in some systems a given feature may
      be in effect throughout the entire program if it is in effect anywhere at
      all. Other systems may have more precise mechanisms to control the scope
      of a feature (this might be the case for example when a module system is
      supported). In general it is thus possible that a feature is in effect in
      some parts of the program and not in others. This allows conflicting
      SRFIs to be present in a given program as long as their scope do not
      intersect.
      <p>SRFI 0 does not prescribe a particular
      mechanism for controlling the presence of a feature as it is our opinion
      that this should be the role of a module system. We expect that future
      module system SRFIs will need to extend the semantics of SRFI 0 for their
      purposes, for example by defining feature scoping rules or by
      generalizing the feature testing construct.</body></html>
