<LI>Withdrawn: 1999/08/26
</UL>
<P>This draft SRFI includes an "Issues" section, whose contents should be
resolved before this proposal is accepted as a final SRFI.

<H1>Abstract</H1>

<p>
This SRFI proposes a coherent and comprehensive set of procedures for
manipulating lists as sets; it is accompanied by a reference implementation
of the spec. The <a href="srfi-3-reference.scm">reference implementation</a> is
</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>portable</li>
	  <li>efficient</li>
	  <li>completely open, public-domain source</li>
	</ul>


<p>
Be aware that these procedures are inherently O(n^2) in the lengths of
their parameter lists - serious set operations on large lists should use
alternate techniques.</p>

<H1>Issues</H1>

<p>
It may well be the case that the 46 procedures in this library should
be folded into the general list library I have submitted as a prior SRFI
proposal. This should be resolved in the course of discussing these two
SRFIs.
</p>

<p>
Should we provide both reliably-destructive and linear-update
(potentially destructive) procedure variants? It really imposes no
<em>implementation</em> overhead to do so - typically, one simply
defines the linear-update name to be either the destructive or purely
functional procedure. We would need a naming convention for
linear-update functions - perhaps a terminal <code>+</code>, e.g.
</p>

<p>
    <code>UNION</code> <code>UNION!</code> <code>UNION+</code>
</p>

<p>
Procedures are, generally speaking, allowed to disorder lists. This
is in keeping with their interpretation as sets. (The initial list parameter
of union and adjoin gets special dispensation.)
</p>

<p> It was too messy to define variants of <code>LSET<=</code> and
<code>LSET=</code> that are specialised for the usual
<code>EQ?</code>, <code>EQV?</code> and <code>EQUAL?</code>
element-equality functions, so I didn't.
</p>

<H1>Rationale</H1>

<p>
The procedures in this library have "pure" and "linear update" variants.  A
"pure" procedure has no side-effects, and in particular does not alter its
arguments in any way. A "linear update" procedure is allowed - but <em>not</em>
required - to side-effect its arguments in order to construct its
result. "Linear update" procedures are typically given names ending with an
exclamation point. So, for example, if the elements of
<code>LIST1</code> and <code>LIST2</code> are
disjoint, then <code>(UNION! LIST1 LIST2)</code> is allowed to construct its result by
simply using <code>SET-CDR!</code> to set the cdr of the last pair of <code>LIST1</code> to point to
<code>LIST2</code>, and then returning <code>LIST1</code>. However, <code>UNION!</code> could also elect to perform a
pure append operation - this is a legal definition of UNION!:
</p>

<p>
    <code>(define union! union)</code>
</p>

<p>
This is why we do not call these procedures "destructive" - because
they aren't <em>required</em> to be destructive. They are
<code>potentially</code> destructive.
</p>

<p>
What this means is that you may only apply linear-update procedures to
values that you know are "dead" - values that will never be used
again in your program. This must be so, since you can't rely on the
value passed to a linear-update procedure after that procedure has
been called. It might be unchanged; it might be altered.
</p>

<H1>Specification</H1>

<p>
There are 46 procedures - 13 basic procedures, and another 33 which
are variants specialised to use the primitive element-equality
procedures <code>EQ?</code>, <code>EQV?</code> and
<code>EQUAL?</code>.
</p>

<h2>Procedure List</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>lset&lt;= = list1 list2 ...</code></li>
<li><code>lset=  = list1 list2 ...</code></li>
<li><code>lset-adjoin = list elt1 ...</code></li>
<li><code>lset-union = list1 ...</code></li>
<li><code>lset-intersection = list1 list2 ...</code></li>
<li><code>lset-difference = list1 list2 ...</code></li>
<li><code>lset-xor = list1 ...</code></li>
<li><code>lset-diff+intersection = list1 list2 ...</code></li>
<li><code>lset-union! lset-intersection! lset-difference! </code></li>
<li><code>lset-xor! lset-diff+intersection!</code></li>
<li><code>adjoin {,q,v}: list elt1 ...</code></li>
<li><code>union {,q,v} {,!}: list1 ...</code></li>
<li><code>intersection {,q,v} {,!}: list1 list2 ...</code></li>

<li><code>list-xor {,q,v} {,!}: list1 ...</code></li>
<li><code>diff+intersection {,q,v} {,!}: list1 list2 ...</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure Specification</h2>

<dl>
<dt><code>lset&lt;= = list1 list2 ... -> boolean</code></dt>
<dd>
      <p>
    Returns true iff every <code>LISTi</code> is a subset of
    <code>LISTi</code>+1, using <code>=</code> for the element equality procedure.
      </p>

      <p>
    <code>(lset&lt;= eq? '(a) '(a b a) '(a b c c)) => #t</code>
      </p>
</dd>

<dt><code>lset= = list1 list2 ... -> boolean</code></dt>
<dd>
   <p>
    Returns true iff every <code>LISTi</code> is set-equal to
    <code>LISTi</code>+1, using <code>=</code> for the element
    equality procedure. "Set-equal" simply means that
    <code>LISTi</code> is a subset of <code>LISTi</code>+1, and
    <code>LISTi</code>+1 is a subset of <code>LISTi</code>.
   </p>

      <p>
    <code>(lset= eq? '(b e a) '(a e b) '(e e b a)) => #t</code>
	</p>

<dt><code>lset-adjoin = list elt1 ... -> list</code></dt>
<dd>
   <p>
    Adds the <code>ELTi</code> elements not already in the list
    parameter to the result list. The result shares a common tail with
    the list parameter.  The new elements are added to the front of
    the list, but no guarantees are made about their order. The
    <code>=</code> parameter is an equality procedure used to
    determine if an <code>ELTi</code> is already a member of
    <code>LIST</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
    The list parameter is always a suffix of the result - even if the list
    parameter contains repeated elements, these are not reduced.
	</p>
   
      <p>
    <code>(lset-adjoin eq? '(a b c d c e) 'a 'e 'i 'o 'u) => (u o i a b c d c e)</code>
	</p>
      </dd>

<dt><code>lset-union = list1 ... -> list</code></dt>
<dd>
 <p>
    Returns the union of the lists, using <code>=</code> for the element equality
    procedure. <code>LIST1</code> is a suffix or tail of the result. Elements that are
    repeated multiple times in a single list parameter may or may not occur
    multiple times in the result; however, an element that occurs once in
    more than one list parameter will only appear once in the result.
  </p>

  <p>
    Elements introduced by <code>LIST2</code> or following parameters occur in no
    particular order.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>(lset-union eq? '(a b c d e) '(a e i o u)) => (u o i a b c d e)</code>
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><code>lset-intersection = list1 list2 ... -> list</code>
<dd>
  <p>
    Returns the intersection of the lists, using <code>=</code> for
    the element equality procedure. The result may share a common tail
    with any of the list parameters. Elements that are repeated
    multiple times in every list parameter may or may not occur
    multiple times in the result; however, an element that occurs only
    once in every list parameter will only appear once in the
    result. No constraint is placed on the ordering of the elements in
    the result.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>(lset-intersection eq? '(a b c d e) '(a e i o u)) => (a e)</code>
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><code>lset-difference = list1 list2 ... -> list</code></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Returns the difference of the lists, using <code>=</code> for the element equality
    procedure - all the elements of <code>LIST1</code> that do not appear in any of the
    other <code>LISTi</code> parameters. The result may share a common tail with <code>LIST1</code>.
    Elements that are repeated multiple times in the <code>LIST1</code> parameter will
    occur multiple times in the result. No constraint is placed on the ordering
    of the elements in the result.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>(lset-difference eq? '(a b c d e) '(a e i o u)) => (b c d)</code>
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><code>lset-xor = list1 ... -> list</code></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Returns the XOR of the lists, using <code>=</code> for the element equality
    procedure. If there are exactly two lists, this is all the elements
    that appear in exactly one of the two lists. The operation is associative,
    and thus extends to the n-ary case - the elements that appear in an
    odd number of the lists. The result may share a common tail with any of
    the <code>LISTi</code> parameters.
  </p>

  <p>
    A list element that occurs multiple times in a single list
    parameter may or may not appear multiple times in the result. For
    example, if <code>LSET-XOR</code> is applied to a single list
    parameter, it is permitted to return <em>exactly</em> that list
    for its result. No constraint is placed on the ordering of the
    elements in the result.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>(lset-xor eq? '(a b c d e) '(a e i o u)) => (d c b i o u)</code>
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><code>lset-diff+intersection = list1 list2 ... -> [list list]</code></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Returns two values - the difference and the union of the lists.
    Is equivalent to 
   </p>

<pre><code>
(values (lset-difference = list1 list2 ...)
        (lset-intersection = list1 list2 ...))
</code></pre>
 
  <p>
    but can be implemented more efficiently.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><code>lset-union!        	= list1 ... -> list</code></dt>
<dt><code>lset-intersection! 	= list1 list2 ... -> list</code></dt>
<dt><code>lset-difference!   	= list1 list2 ... -> list</code></dt>
<dt><code>lset-xor!          	= list1 ... -> list</code></dt>
<dt><code>lset-diff+intersection! = list1 list2 ... -> [list list]</code></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    These are linear-update variants. They are allowed, but not
    required, to use the cons cells in their first list parameter to
    construct their answer. <code>LSET-UNION!</code> is permitted to
    recycle cons cells from <em>any</em> of its lists arguments.
  <p>
</dd>
</dl>


The following variants of the general lset procedures use
<code>EQUAL?</code>, <code>EQ?</code>, and <code>EQV?</code> for
element comparison, respectively.

<pre><code>
union   list1 ... -> list		union!  list1 ... -> list
unionq  list1 ... -> list		unionq! list1 ... -> list
unionv  list1 ... -> list		unionv! list1 ... -> list

intersection   list1 list2 ... -> list	intersection!  list1 list2 ... -> list
intersectionq  list1 list2 ... -> list	intersectionq! list1 list2 ... -> list
intersectionv  list1 list2 ... -> list	intersectionv! list1 list2 ... -> list

list-xor   list1 ... -> list		list-xor!  list1 ... -> list
list-xorq  list1 ... -> list		list-xorq! list1 ... -> list
list-xorv  list1 ... -> list		list-xorv! list1 ... -> list

adjoin  list elt1 ... -> list
adjoinq list elt1 ... -> list
adjoinv list elt1 ... -> list

list-difference   list1 list2 ... -> list	
list-differenceq  list1 list2 ... -> list	
list-differencev  list1 list2 ... -> list	
list-difference!  list1 list2 ... -> list
list-differenceq! list1 list2 ... -> list
list-differencev! list1 list2 ... -> list

diff+intersection   list1 list2 ... -> list
diff+intersectionq  list1 list2 ... -> list
diff+intersectionv  list1 list2 ... -> list
diff+intersection!  list1 list2 ... -> list
diff+intersectionq! list1 list2 ... -> list
diff+intersectionv! list1 list2 ... -> list
</code></pre>

<H1>Implementation</H1>

<A HREF=srfi-3-reference.scm>Source for the reference implementation.</A>

<a name="linear-update"></a><h1>Linear Update</h1>

<p>
The "linear" in "linear update" doesn't mean "linear time" or "linear space"
or any sort of multiple-of-n kind of meaning. It's a fancy term that
pointy-headed type theorists and pure functional programmers use to describe
systems where you are only allowed to have exactly one reference to each
variable. This provides a guarantee that the value bound to a variable is
bound to no other variable. So when you <em>use</em> a variable in a variable
reference, you "use it up." Knowing that no one else has a pointer to that
value means the a system primitive is free to side-effect its arguments to
produce what is, observationally, a pure-functional result.
 </p>

<p>
In the context of this library, "linear update" means you, the programmer,
know there are <em>no other</em> live references to the value passed to the
procedure - after passing the value to one of these procedures, the
value of the old pointer is indeterminate. Basically, you are licensing
the Scheme implementation to alter the data structure if it feels like
it - you have declared you don't care either way.
<p>

<p>
You get no help from Scheme in checking that the values you claim are
"linear" really are. So you better get it right. Or play it safe and
use the non-<code>!</code> procedures - doesn't do any good to
compute quickly if you get the wrong answer.
</p>

<p>
Why go to all this trouble to define the notion of "linear update" and use it
in a procedure spec, instead of the more common notion of a "destructive"
operation?  First, note that destructive list-processing procedures are almost
always used in a linear-update fashion. This is in part required by the
special case of operating upon the empty list, which can't be side-effected.
This means that destructive operators are not pure side-effects - they have
to return a result. Second, note that code written using linear-update
operators can be trivially ported to a pure, functional subset of Scheme by
simply providing pure implementations of the linear-update operators. Finally,
requiring destructive side-effects ruins opportunities to parallelise these
operations - and the places where one has taken the trouble to spell out
destructive operations are usually exactly the code one would want a
parallelising compiler to parallelise: the efficiency-critical kernels of the
algorithm.  Linear-update operations are easily parallelised. Going with a
linear-update spec doesn't close off these valuable alternative implementation
techniques. This list library is intended as a set of low-level, basic
operators, so we don't want to exclude these possible implementations.
