<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This SRFI defines a comprehensive I/O subsystem for Scheme with three layers, where each layer is built on top of the one below it:</p><ul><li>The lowest, primitive layer provides unbuffered I/O, and is close to what a typical operating system offers.</li><li>The middle layer builds on lazy, mostly functional buffered streams.</li><li>The upper layer is similar in nature to the ports subsystem in R5RS, and provides conventional, imperative buffered input and output.</li></ul><p>The layer architecture is similar to the upper three layers of the I/O subsystem in <a href="http://www.standardml.org/Basis/">The Standard ML Basis Library</a>.</p><p>In particular, the subsystem provides</p><ul><li>buffered reading and writing</li><li>arbitrary lookahead at the streams level</li><li>dynamic redirection of input or output at the ports level</li><li>binary and text I/O, mixed if needed</li><li>translated data streams</li><li>unbuffered I/O at the primitive layer</li><li>the ability to create arbitrary I/O streams, such to and from byte vectors and strings</li></ul><p>The subsystem does <em>not</em> provide</p><ul><li>formatted I/O</li><li>non-blocking or selective I/O</li><li>portable filenames, or any functionality for manipulating filenames</li><li>filesystem operations</li><li>socket I/O</li><li>extremely high-throughput or zero-copy I/O</li></ul><p>However, all of these could be added on top of one or several of the layers specified in this SRFI.</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>The I/O subsystem in R5RS is too limited in many respects:  It only provides for for text I/O, it only allows reading at the character and the datum level, and some of the primitives are mis-designed or underspecified.  As a result, almost every Scheme implementation has its own extensions to the I/O system, and rarely are two of these extensions compatible.</p><p>This SRFI is meant as a compelling replacement for the R5RS I/O subsystem.  As such, it is a completely new design, and it is not based on the extensions a particular existing Scheme system provides.  (In fact, it is probably, in its entirety, unlike what any existing Scheme system provides.)  Moreover, it is meant to be a substrate for further extensions which can be built on top of the subsystem via the interface described here.</p><p>The design of this SRFI is driven by the requirements mentioned in the abstract on the one hand, and on the excellent design of the I/O subsystem in the Standard ML Basis Library. The is latter is also the reason why this SRFI is different from the extensions provided by any existing Scheme implementation, as none of them picked up on the Basis design, and because the Basis design seems superior to the extensions I have looked at.  (Among those I have looked at are Scheme 48, scsh, Gambit-C, and PLT Scheme.)</p><p>Note, however, that this SRFI differs from the SML Basis in several important respects, among the handling of textual I/O streams, the ability to define translated streams, and the absence of any functionality related to non-blocking I/O.  The latter is more properly in the domain of a thread/even system; Concurrent ML shows that the SML Basis plays well with such a system, and I expect the same to hold true here.  The text encoding/translation functionality is different mainly because it plays to a different substrate for representing text (based on Unicode; see below) than Standard ML.</p><p>Like the Standard ML Basis I/O subsystem, the I/O system specified in this SRFI is probably not suitable for maximal-throughput I/O, chiefly because it does not re-use buffers, and because the buffer objects are byte vectors, with no further constraints on alignment or GC behavior.  However, I deemed the achievable performance as more than adequate for most applications---it seemed a small price to pay for the convenient programming model.</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>This SRFI is meant for Scheme implementations with the following prerequisites:</p><ul><li>support for SRFIs <a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-34/">34</a> (Exception Handling for Programs), <a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-35/">35</a> (Conditions), <a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-66/">66</a> (Byte Vectors)</li><li>Unicode support</li></ul><h2>Unicode support</h2><p>This SRFI assumes that the <code>char</code> datatype in Scheme to correspond to Unicode scalar values.  This, in turn, means that strings are represented as vectors of scalar values. (Note that this is consistent with <a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-14/">14</a> (Character-set library).) It may be possible to make this SRFI work in an ASCII- or Latin-1-only system, but I have not made any special provisions to ensure this.</p><h2>Filenames</h2><p>Some of the procedures described here accept a filename <var>filename</var> as an argument.  Valid values for such a filename include strings naming a file using the native notation of the operating system the Scheme implementation happens to be running on.</p><p>It is expected that a future SRFI will extend this set of values by a more abstract representation: This is necessary, as the most common operating systems do not really use strings for representing filenames, but rather byte sequences.  Moreover, the string notation is difficult to manipulate and not very portable.</p><h2>General remarks</h2><p>For procedures that have no &quot;natural&quot; return value, this SRFI often uses the sentence</p><p><em>The return values are unspecified.</em></p><p>This means that number of return values  and the return values are unspecified.  However, the number of return values  is such that it is accepted by a continuation created by <code>begin</code>.  Specifically, on Scheme implementations where continuations created by <code>begin</code> accept an arbitrary number of arguments (this includes most implementations), it is suggested that the procedure return zero return values.</p><h2>Organization</h2><p>The I/O subsystem consists of three layers.  Each layer can function independently from those above it.  Moreover, each layer can be used without referring directly to the ones below it.  Therefore, a Scheme implementation with a module system should offer each layer as an independent module.  Moreover, some data extensions are common to all three I/O layers---specifically, the common I/O condition types.</p><h3>Data extensions</h3><h4>Condition types</h4><p>The I/O conditition type hierarchy here is similar, but not identical to the one described in <a href="http://srfi.speechcode.com/srfi-36/">36</a> (I/O Conditions).</p><p>The following list depicts the I/O condition hierarchy; more detailed explanations of the condition types follow.</p><ul><li><code>&amp;error</code><br><ul><li><code>&amp;i/o-error</code><br><ul><li><code>&amp;i/o-read-error</code></li><li><code>&amp;i/o-write-error</code></li><li><code>&amp;i/o-closed-error</code></li><li><code>&amp;i/o-invalid-position-error</code></li></ul><br><ul><li><code>&amp;i/o-filename-error</code> (has a <code>filename</code> field)<br><ul><li><code>&amp;i/o-malformed-filename-error</code></li><li><code>&amp;i/o-file-protection-error</code><br><ul><li><code>&amp;i/o-file-is-read-only-error</code></li></ul></li><li><code>&amp;i/o-file-already-exists-error</code></li><li><code>&amp;i/o-no-such-file-error</code></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>In exceptional situations not described as &quot;it is an error&quot;, the procedures described in the specification below will raise an <code>&amp;i/o-error</code> condition object.  Except where explicitly specified, there is no guarantee that the raised condition object will contain all the information that would be applicable.  It is recommended, however, that an implementation of this SRFI provide all information about an exceptional situation in the condition object that is available at the place where it is detected.</p><dl><dt><pre>(define-condition-type &amp;i/o-error &amp;error

The objects representing I/O descriptors are called <em>readers</em> for input and <em>writers</em> for output.  They are unbuffered and operate purely on binary data.</p><p>This layer only specifies a fairly small set of operations --- a subset of the Standard ML Basis <code>PRIM_IO</code> signature.  Specifically, all functionality related to non-blocking I/O or polling is missing here.  This is intentional, as this functionality should be integrated with the threads system of the underlying implementation, and is thus outside the scope of this (already large) SRFI.  Instead, it is expected that the set of operations available on primitive I/O readers and writers will be augmented by future specifications, as will be the available constructors for these objects.</p><p>The Primitive I/O layer introduces one condition type of its own.</p><dl><dt><p><pre>(define-condition-type &amp;i/o-reader/writer-error &amp;i/o-error

</pre></p></dt><dd><p>This condition type allows specifying with what particular reader or writer an I/O error is associated.  The <code>reader/writer</code> field has purely informational purpose.  Conditions raised in by Primitive I/O procedures <em>may</em> include an <code>&amp;i/o-reader/writer-error</code> condition, but are not required to do so.</p></dd></dl><h4>Readers</h4><p>A reader object typically stands for a file or device descriptor, but can also represent the output of some algorithm, such as in the case of string readers.  The sequence of bytes represented is potentially unbounded, and is punctuated by end of file elements.</p><dl><dt><code>(reader? </code><var>obj</var><code>)</code></dt><dd><p><p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <var>obj</var> is a reader, otherwise returns <code>#f</code>.</p></p></dd><dt><code>(make-simple-reader </code><var>id</var> <var>descriptor</var> <var>chunk-size</var> <var>read-byte!</var> <var>available-bytes</var> <var>get-position</var> <var>set-position!</var> <var>end-position</var> <var>close</var><code>)</code></dt><dd><p>Returns a reader object. <var>Id</var> is a string naming the reader, provided for informational purposes only.

This is typically the block size of the buffers of the operating system.

A value of 1 represents a recommendation to use unbuffered reads.</p><p>The remaining arguments are procedures --- <var>get-position</var>, <var>set-position!</var>, and <var>end-position</var> may be omitted, in which case the corresponding arguments must be <code>#f</code>.</p><dl><dt><code>(<var>read-bytes!</var> </code><var>bytes</var> <var>start</var> <var>count</var><code>)</code></dt><dd><p><var>Start</var> and <var>count</var> must be non-negative exact integers.

These operations include binary and textual I/O.  Input streams are treated in lazy functional style: input from a stream <var>s</var> yields an object representing the input itself, and a new  input stream <var>s1</var>.  <var>S</var> will continue to represent exactly the same position within the input; to advance within the stream, the program needs to perform input from <var>s1</var>.  Consequently, input streams allow arbitrary lookahead, which is especially convenient for all kinds of scanning.</p><p>Output streams are more conventional, as the lazy functional style does not make sense with output.</p><p>Both input streams and output streams are either directly connected to underlying readers and writers, or are defined by translation on an underlying stream.  This makes it possible to perform trivial transformations such as CR/LF translation, but also transparent recoding on the streams.</p><p>Textual I/O always uses UTF-8 as the underlying encoding.  Other encodings can easily be supported by translating to or from UTF-8 using the translation framework.  If a decoding error occurs, the implicit decoder will skip the byte starting the character encoding, yield a ? character, and attempt to continue decoding after that initial byte.</p><p>The Stream I/O layer adds an additional condition type:</p><pre>(define-condition-type &amp;i/o-stream-error &amp;i/o-error

<h1>Design rationale</h1>
<h3>Encoding</h3><p>Many I/O system implementations allow associating an encoding with a port, allowing the direct use of several different encodings with ports.  The problem with this approach is that the encoding/decoding defines a mapping from binary data to text or vice versa.  Because of this asymmetry, such mappings do not compose.  The result is usually complications and restrictions in the I/O API, such as the inability to mix text or binary data, or the inability to change encoding mid-stream.</p><p>This SRFI avoids this problem by specifying that textual I/O always uses UTF-8.  This means that, if the target or source of an I/O stream is to use a different encoding, a translated stream needs to be used, for which this SRFI offers the required facilities.  This means that text decoders or encoders are expressed as binary-to-binary mappings, and as such compose.</p><p>It would easily be possible to construct a library of text recoders for use with this SRFI, possibly connected to some notion of locale.  This would properly be the subject of another SRFI, however.</p><h3><code>display-char</code> vs <code>write-char</code></h3><p>R5RS calls the procedure for writing a character to an output port <code>write-char</code>.  This is inconsistent with the behavior of <code>write</code>, which outputs characters using the <code>\#</code> notation.  Instead, it is consistent with the behavior of <code>display</code>, which is why the procedure is called <code>display-char</code> here, and why the other port output procedures have names starting with <code>display-</code>.</p><p>Historically, it seems that the <a href="http://zurich.ai.mit.edu/pipermail/rrrs-authors/1985-March.txt">original proposal for the I/O subsystem in RnRS</a> indeed called the procedure <code>display-char</code>.  I do not know why it was renamed---probably for compatibility with Common Lisp, which also has <code>write-char</code>.</p><h3><code>char-ready?</code></h3><p>This SRFI intentionally does not provide <code>char-ready?</code>, which is part of R5RS.  The original intention of the procedure seems to have been to interface with something like Unix <code>select(2)</code>.  With multi-byte encodings such as UTF-8, this is no longer sufficient: the procedure would really have to look at the actual input data in order to determine whether a complete character is actually present.  This makes realistic implementations of <code>char-ready?</code> inconsistent with the user's expectations.  A procedure <code>byte-ready?</code> would be more consistent.  On the other hand, such a procedure is rarely useful in real-world programs, and complicates all layers of the I/O system, as readers would have to provide an additional member procedure to enable its implementation.  Moreover, a <code>select(2)</code>-like implementation is not possible on all plattforms and all types of ports.  Consequently, <code>char-ready?</code> and <code>byte-ready?</code>are not part of this SRFI.</p><h3><code>display</code></h3><p>This SRFI does not provide <code>display</code>, which is part of R5RS.  <code>Display</code> is woefully underspecified, and mostly used to output strings.  For this purpose, this SRFI offers <code>display-string</code>.</p><h3>No distinct end of file object</h3><p>In R5RS, the distinct type of end of file objects is primarily for the benefit of <code>read</code>, where end of file must be denoted by an object that <code>read</code> cannot normally return as a result of parsing the input.  However, it does not seem necessary to drag in the complications of this separate object into a pure I/O SRFI, where <code>#f</code> or the empty byte vector or the empty string is perfectly adequate to represent end of file.</p><p>It is debatable whether not all input procedures should denote end of file by <code>#f</code>.  The present arrangement is the way it is primarily because it is that way in the SML Basis Library.</p>

<h1>Reference Implementation</h1>
<p><a href="comprehensive-io-reference.tar.gz">Here</a> is a tarball containing a reference implementation of this SRFI.  It only runs on a version of Scheme 48 that has not been released at the time of writing in this SRFI.</p><p>However, its actual dependencies on Scheme 48 idiosyncracies are few.  Chief are its use of the module system, which is easily replaced by another, and the implementation of Unicode.  To implement primitive readers and writers on files, the code only relies on suitable library procedures to open the files, and <code>read-byte</code> and <code>write-byte</code> procedures to read or write single bytes from a (R5RS) port, as well as a <code>force-output</code> procedure to flush a port.</p><p>The reference implementation has not been highly tuned, but I have spent a modest amount of time making the code deal with buffers in an economic buffer.  Because of this, the code is more complicated than it needs to be, but hopefully also more usable as a basis for implementing this SRFI in actual Scheme systems.</p>
