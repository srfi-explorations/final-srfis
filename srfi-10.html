<H1>Related SRFIs</H1>

<P>As an extensible external notation the proposed <CODE>#,()</CODE>
form
 is intended to be specialized in other SRFIs, especially those that
introduce new types of Scheme values. One example is <A
HREF="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-4/">SRFI-4</A>, "Homogeneous
numeric vector datatypes". The external representation for float
vectors was in "minor nonconformance to Standard Scheme." The present
SRFI avoids this conflict. This SRFI can also solve a problem of
representing a 2D matrix with a zero dimension, mentioned in a SRFI-4
discussion archive. Incidentally, SRFI-4 discussion was the
inspiration for the present proposal.

<P>This SRFI discusses and emulates reader-macros and specific
sharpsign forms of <A
HREF="http://www.harlequin.com/education/books/HyperSpec/Body/">Common
Lisp</A>.


<H1>Abstract</H1>
<P>The present SRFI proposes an extensible external representation of
Scheme values, a notational convention for future SRFIs. This SRFI
adds <CODE>#,(</CODE> as a new token and extends production rules of
the grammar for a Scheme reader. The <CODE>#,()</CODE> form can be
used for example to denote values that do not have a convenient
printed representation, as well for conditional code compilation. It
is proposed that future SRFIs that contain new read syntax for values
use the <CODE>#,()</CODE> notation with an appropriate tag symbol.
<P>As a particular example and the reference implementation for the
<CODE>#,()</CODE> convention, this SRFI describes an interpretation of
the <CODE>#,()</CODE> external form as a read-time application.



<H1>Issues</H1>

<H1>Rationale</H1>

<P>
External representations of booleans, numbers, lists, vectors, strings
are codified in RnRS. Every Scheme reader has an in-born knowledge how
to parse the corresponding strings and build Scheme values they
represent. The set of these built-in constructors is however fixed,
and not amenable. This SRFI proposes to lift this limitation, to allow
printed representation and serialization for ports, structures, wills,
semaphores and other datatypes present in many Scheme systems as well
as datatypes that may be introduced in future SRFIs.
It has to be stressed however that the proposed external form can
denote not only structural, record and esoteric data but standard
Scheme values as well, whose canonical representation is cumbersome,
dependent on external circumstances or otherwise unsuitable. 
<P>
The <CODE>#,()</CODE> notation may appear in <I>any</I> character
stream intended to be processed by a <CODE>read</CODE> procedure. For
example, a <CODE>#,()</CODE> form can be used in a stream being read
solely for data, as a source of initial values and other parameters
for a specific algorithm. On the other hand, a character stream may
contain Scheme code to be read and evaluated. In such streams
<CODE>#,()</CODE> forms can denote either literal values or code to be
conditionally compiled.
<P>
A future SRFI-X may introduce a new distinct type of Scheme
values and intend the values of this type to be  written and read. Any
such SRFI has to extend the formal syntax of Scheme: R5RS Sections
7.1.1 and 7.1.2. The most common way of such an extension is
<PRE>        "#" &lt;discriminator&gt; &lt;other-char&gt;*</PRE>
where <CODE>&lt;discriminator&gt;</CODE> is one character other than
'<CODE>(</CODE>', '<CODE>\</CODE>', '<CODE>i</CODE>',
'<CODE>e</CODE>', '<CODE>b</CODE>', '<CODE>o</CODE>',
'<CODE>x</CODE>', '<CODE>d</CODE>' and possibly '<CODE>f</CODE>',
'<CODE>!</CODE>' and '<CODE>t</CODE>'. There does not appear to be
too much choice for the <CODE>&lt;discriminator&gt;</CODE>, especially
if one wants to make it mnemonic.

<P>SRFI-10 proposes another, systematic and expressive way of adding
new
external representations of scheme values, namely, via a
<CODE>#,(&lt;tag&gt; &lt;datum&gt;*)</CODE> form. A particular SRFI-X
that introduces a new data type should simply pick an appropriate
<CODE>&lt;tag&gt;</CODE> (a symbol) and decide upon
<CODE>&lt;datum&gt;</CODE>-arguments. The SRFI-X no longer has to add
new productions to the external syntax,  nor does it need to fight for
the remaining characters that may be used as the
<CODE>&lt;discriminator&gt;</CODE>. Implementations of the SRFI-X
should support writing of values of the new datatype in the
<CODE>#,()</CODE> form, and reading them back. The exact way of doing
that is however up to the SRFI-X or its implementations.
<P>
The <CODE>#,()</CODE> notation is useful not only for new types of
values. Existing Scheme datatypes can benefit from it as well: for
example, cyclical lists
and other structures with circular dependencies, data structures
with large caches or memoization tables, etc. In another possible
scenario one may introduce the following external forms:
<PRE>        #,(pi) #,(epsilon) #,(Infinity) #,(NaN)</PRE> 
which represent rather useful (inexact) numbers.
<P>
Yet another application area for the proposed notation is "variable
constants", e.g., <CODE>#,(os-type)</CODE>. The Scheme reader would
replace every instance of <CODE>#,(os-type)</CODE> with an appropriate
literal, e.g., <CODE>"Solaris"</CODE>, <CODE>"HP-UX"</CODE>. Since
this "binding" occurs very early, the corresponding string can be
analyzed in various macros, syntax and other special forms. Another
useful notation of the same kind is <CODE>#,(srfi-features)</CODE>,
which can be replaced by the list of feature identifiers the current
implementation supports.
<P>
It is important to note the differences between <CODE>#,(foo)</CODE>
and seemingly similar constructions <CODE>(macro-expand-foo)</CODE>
and <CODE>(force (delay (compute-foo))</CODE>. The former is processed
at read-time. Therefore it may meaningfully appear in input streams
being <CODE>read</CODE> and processed solely as data. The other forms
may only be used in input streams meant to be passed to a compiler or
otherwise evaluated. Furthermore, an evaluator/macro-expander never
sees <CODE>#,(foo)</CODE> forms. When a compiler/interpreter reads an
expression any <CODE>#,(foo)</CODE> forms that may have occurred in
the input stream will already be replaced by Scheme values they
represent. This is similar to handling of abbreviations (R5RS 7.1.2),
e.g., <CODE>'bar</CODE>. An evaluator never comes across an apostrophe
as a token: all the evaluator gets is a list of two elements, the
first of them being <CODE>quote</CODE>. If  <CODE>#,(foo)</CODE>
happens to occur within a special form, that syntax will never see
<CODE>#,(foo)</CODE> as it is -- it will see the corresponding
<I>literal</I>. In contrast, <CODE>(force (delay (compute-foo))</CODE>
or <CODE>(macro-expand-foo)</CODE> used as arguments to a special form
will be passed to that form as <I>expressions</I> rather than the
values they evaluate/expand to.


<H1>Specification</H1>
<P>
The present SRFI extends the grammar for external representations
-- R5RS Section 7.1.2 "External representations" -- as follows:
<PRE>
&lt;datum&gt; ---&gt; &lt;simple datum&gt; | &lt;compound datum&gt; | &lt;hash-comma-datum&gt;

&lt;hash-comma-datum&gt; ---&gt; "#,(" &lt;tag&gt; &lt;datum&gt;* ")"
&lt;tag&gt; ---&gt; &lt;symbol&gt; | &lt;hash-comma-datum&gt;
</PRE>

Furthermore, the production for <CODE>&lt;token&gt;</CODE> in R5RS
Sec. 7.1.1 is amended to read<PRE>
&lt;token&gt; ---&gt; &lt;identifier&gt; | &lt;boolean&gt; | &lt;number&gt; | &lt;character&gt; | &lt;string&gt;
           | ( | ) | #( | ' | ` | , | ,@ | . | #,(
</PRE>

<P>This SRFI does not specify how the Scheme reader interprets a
specific <CODE>&lt;hash-comma-datum&gt;</CODE> and creates the
corresponding Scheme value. This is left to particular SRFIs. The
behavior of the reader when it fails to interpret a <CODE>#,()</CODE>
form is also unspecified.


<H1>Implementation</H1>
<P>
The Scheme reports do not define behavior of a reader in case the
input stream does not follow the grammar for external representations
(R5RS 7.1.2). In particular the reader is not required to report an
error. The set of all input streams that can be read without a
mandatory error reporting is the same no matter if SRFI-10 is in
effect or not. In this sense, SRFI-10 does not change the language,
therefore, SRFI-10 is already "implemented" in any existing Scheme
system.

<H2>Read-time application</H2>

Read-time application is a particular implementation of SRFI-10, where
the word "implementation" is taken in a more constructive
sense. Read-time application is similar to Smalltalk's object
serialization and <CODE>#.</CODE> and <CODE>#S()</CODE> reader-macros
of Common Lisp. It interprets the
<CODE>&lt;hash-comma-datum&gt;</CODE> of the amended grammar for
external representations
<PRE>"#,(" &lt;tag&gt; &lt;datum&gt;* ")"</PRE>
where a <CODE>tag</CODE> must be an (external representation of an)
identifier, and <CODE>datum</CODE> etc. are external representations
of some values, which may be read-time applications as well. The
<I>read</I> procedure should look up a reader-constructor associated
with the <CODE>tag</CODE>, read the arguments
<CODE>datum</CODE>... and apply the constructor to the arguments. The
result of the application is taken to be the value that corresponds to
the <CODE>#,()</CODE> external form. It is an error if a
reader-constructor associated with the <CODE>tag</CODE> cannot be
located.
<P>
There are several possible ways to specify an association between
symbolic tags and constructor procedures. For example, an
implementation may:
<UL>
<LI>offer a <I>fixed</I> set of specific symbolic tags and
associated constructor procedures;
<LI>provide a set of symbolic tags and associated constructor
procedures. A user however may enable or disable some of them at
start-up time, via configurational files,
command-line options, environment variables and other similar means;
<LI>allow a user to add new constructor procedures and
associated tags at application's start-up time, by specifying
extension modules;
<LI>permit a user to add new constructor procedures at run-time.
For example, an implementation may provide a procedure
<PRE>     define-reader-ctor SYMBOL PROC</PRE>
for that purpose. 
<LI>a Scheme system may allow creation of new associations of
symbolic tags and existing constructor procedures at read-time, via a
dedicated reader-constructor, e.g.,
<PRE>     #,(define-reader-ctor 'f32 f32vector)</PRE>
</UL>

<P>The present SRFI-10 reference implementation provides the
<CODE>define-reader-ctor</CODE> function. The examples below assume
this particular choice.

<H3>Comparisons</H3>

<P>The read-time application mechanism is rather close to Lisp
reader's macro functions. Unlike Common Lisp, however, a
reader-constructor is not allowed to read from the input stream on its
own. It may only build values from other values, which must have
already been read and internalized. A reader-constructor must always
return one value; it may not return "nothing". It may however throw an
exception or simply return an "inappropriate" value such as
<CODE>#f</CODE>, which will be caught later. Unlike compile-time
function applications (that is, macro-expansions), a read-time
application has no "second pass". Since a <CODE>#,()</CODE> form is
completely read when a reader-constructor is called, we can relax a
Common Lisp's prohibition on side-effects in the constructor. Unlike
CL reader macro function, a reader-constructor cannot be called
repeatedly during reading of a single, non-nested <CODE>#,()</CODE>
form. Besides, prohibition on side effects is very difficult to
enforce. Lifting it does not constitute encouragement of
side-effecting
reader-constructors however.
<P>
Common Lisp defines an external form <CODE>#.obj</CODE>, which
instructs the Lisp reader to evaluate <CODE>obj</CODE> right after the
reader parsed it. While <CODE>#.</CODE> is a general-purpose
read-evaluator:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>#.obj === (eval obj)</CODE><BR>
<CODE>#,</CODE>  is merely an application:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>#,obj === (apply (lookup
(car obj)) (cdr obj))</CODE><BR>
and <CODE>obj</CODE> must be an external representation of a
list. Read-time application is weaker than a generic read-time
evaluation, and therefore less expensive. Example 5 below  illustrates
the difference. 

<P>Read-time applications are further restricted to only those
procedures that have been specifically declared for that purpose (via
<CODE>define-reader-ctor</CODE>). The user thus has a fine-grained
control over which functions are being applied at read
time. Performing arbitrary computations at read time is a security
concern: for example, when an application server reads data from a
request pipe, it does not want unexpected functions with potentially
dangerous side-effects to be invoked.  In Common Lisp one can avoid
this undesirable behavior -- in an all-or-nothing-fashion -- by
setting a distinguished global variable  <CODE>*read-eval*</CODE> to
<CODE>nil</CODE>. This however will globally turn off evaluation of
all <CODE>#.</CODE> forms, even those which are deemed safe and
appropriate. Registration of reader-constructors required in this
reference implementation enables therefore a fine-grained control over
read-time computations. Furthermore, the reference implementation
registers reader-constructors in a readtable. Different invocations of
the reader may execute or flag read-time applications differently
depending on a readtable in effect. 

<P>Common Lisp defines a <CODE>#S(typename . data)</CODE> notation
that constructs values at read-time yet requires prior registration of
constructors. It happens  only to be used for structures. This SRFI
generalizes this notation, enabling read-time applications to compute
arbitrary values, including S-expressions intended to be
compiled/interpreted. 

<H3>Examples</H3>

<H4>Example 1</H4>

<P>Alternative printed representations for standard Scheme datatypes
and other <I>values</I>
<PRE>
   (define-reader-ctor 'list list) 
   (with-input-from-string "#,(list 1 2 #f \"4 5\")" read) ==&gt; (1 2 #f "4 5")

   (define-reader-ctor '+ +)
   (with-input-from-string "#,(+ 1 2)" read) ==&gt; 3
</PRE>

<H4>Example 2</H4>

Readable representations for structures (records)
<PRE>
   (define-reader-ctor 'my-vector
     (lambda x (apply vector (cons 'my-vector-tag x))))
   (with-input-from-string "#,(my-vector (my-vector 1 2))" read) ==&gt;
       a vector whose second element is a list of a symbol my-vector,
       number 1, and number 2.
   (with-input-from-string "#,(my-vector #,(my-vector 1 2))" read) ==&gt;
       a vector whose second element is a my-vector constructed from
       numbers 1 and 2.
   (with-input-from-string "#,(my-vector #,(my-vector #,(+ 9 -4)))" read) ==&gt;
       '#(my-vector-tag #(my-vector-tag 5))
</PRE>

<H4>Example 3</H4>
Representing uniform vectors (per SRFI-4) in the <CODE>#,</CODE>
notation
<PRE>
   (define-reader-ctor 'f32 f32vector)
   (with-input-from-string "#,(f32 1.0 2.0 3.0)" read) ==&gt;
       a uniform f32 vector with three elements
</PRE>

<H4>Example 4</H4>
External representations for 'complex' datatypes, eg, <I>ports</I>
<PRE>
   (define-reader-ctor 'file open-input-file)
   (with-input-from-string "#,(file \"/tmp/a\")"
     (lambda () (read-char (read)))
</PRE>
will return the first character of the file "<CODE>/tmp/a</CODE>"

<H4>Example 5</H4>

   (with-input-from-string "#,(+ 1 #,(+ 2 3))" read) ==&gt; 6
</PRE>
In contrast, in Common Lisp
<PRE>
   (with-input-from-string (is "#.(+ 1 (+ 2 3))") (read is))  ==&gt; 6
</PRE>

<H4>Example 6</H4>
Loading of a file containing a read-time application: assuming a file
"<CODE>foo.scm</CODE>" contains
<PRE>
   (define (temp-proc)
     (let ((v '#,(f32 1.0 2.0 3.0))) (f32vector-ref v 1)))
</PRE>
then
<PRE>
   (define-reader-ctor 'f32 f32vector)
   (load "foo.scm")
   (pp temp-proc) ==&gt; 
       (lambda () (let ((v '#f32(1. 2. 3.))) (f32vector-ref v 1)))

The implementation is directly based on a grammar given in SRFI-0. We
assume that "feature identifiers" in effect are contained in a list
<CODE>ALL-FEATURES</CODE>. This list should either be pre-defined in a
Scheme system, or otherwise defined prior to reading the code in
question. This implementation demonstrates how to customize a Gambit
Scheme interpreter before it started
evaluating user's code. The modification includes enabling SRFI-10,
SRFI-0, and building a list of features. The reader-ctor code
hopefully demonstrates that the changes to the reader required to
implement <CODE>cond-expand</CODE> are minor and straightforward --
contrary to what SRFI-0 assumed.
