<h1><a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h1>

<p>This SRFI defines a standard for locating files containing libraries with
list-of-symbols library names, for unixes and Windows.  It defines a standard
for files containing R6RS libraries.  It supports different Scheme dialects.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<h1><a name="rationale">Rationale</a></h1>

<p>For libraries to be portably organized, distributed, and available for
importing, using prevalent file systems, a standard is needed for naming and
finding the files containing libraries. The
<a href="http://www.r6rs.org/">R6RS</a> does not specify how libraries are to be
made available for importing, and this SRFI addresses that by providing a
standard for R6RS library files.  Other dialects with list-of-symbols library
names might need a standard for library files, and this SRFI addresses that by
supporting such dialects.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<h1><a name="design">Design</a></h1>

<p>This SRFI provides a standard for locating files based on library names such
that each symbol is used as a file-name component.  List-of-symbols library
names allow hierarchical grouping of libraries by shared name prefixes, which is
useful for avoiding name conflicts with others' libraries and for organizing
related libraries.  Such library names are similar to file names which are a
sequence of strings naming a file in a hierarchy of directories.  This
similarity is exploited to hierarchically organize library files in the way
which corresponds to hierarchical library names.</p>

<p>This SRFI supports files which each contain only one library.  This supports
one-to-one mapping library-file names to library names, which supports knowing
what libraries are available and where they are located, from only file
names.</p>

<p>This SRFI provides a configurable sequence of searched directories and
initializes it from a standard environment variable.  This supports variable and
multiple locations of library files, overlaying library files, and having
different Scheme systems use the same library files.</p>

<p>This SRFI provides a configurable sequence of recognized file-name extensions
and initializes it from a standard environment variable.  This supports
Scheme-system-specific libraries, multiple Scheme dialects, and using arbitrary
extensions.</p>

<p>This SRFI specifies an ordering of multiple files matching a library name so
the first-ordered file can be chosen.</p>

<p>To support portability of R6RS library files, this SRFI specifies a standard
file format and file-name extension for them and requires R6RS systems to
implement this standard.</p>

<h1><a name="specification">Specification</a></h1>

<h3><a name="library-files">Library Files</a></h3>

<p>A <i>library file</i> is a file which contains a library and which has a name
derived from the name of the contained library.  Files conforming to this SRFI
have one library per file.</p>

<p>A <i>library-file name</i> consists of, in order: possibly a
searched-directory name, a sequence of components corresponding to the sequence
of symbols in the contained library's name, and an extension.  A <i>relative
library-file name</i> is a library-file name without a searched-directory name.
An <i>absolute library-file name</i> is a library-file name with a
searched-directory name.</p>

<h3><a name="searched-directories">Searched Directories</a></h3>

<p>The <i>sequence of searched-directory names</i> is used to find library files
such that each directory name is prepended to each relative library-file name to
make the set of file names of possible library files.</p>

<p>The operating-system environment variable <code>SCHEME_LIB_PATH</code>, if it
is defined, is used to initialize the sequence.  Its value is a string
containing a sequence of directory names separated by the <code>#\:</code>
character for unixes or the <code>#\;</code> character for Windows.  Scheme
systems may initialize the sequence to include additional directory names.
Systems may have mechanisms to cause the variable to be ignored.  Systems may
have mechanisms to reconfigure the sequence after it is initialized.</p>

<h3><a name="file-name-extensions">File-Name Extensions</a></h3>

<p>The <i>sequence of recognized file-name extensions</i> is used to find
library files such that each extension is appended to each incomplete
library-file name to make the set of file names of possible library files.
Extensions need to have <code>#\.</code> as their first character if it is
desired that extensions be separated from the file-name prefix by it.</p>

<p>The operating-system environment variable <code>SCHEME_LIB_EXTENSIONS</code>,
if it is defined, is used to initialize the sequence.  Its value is a string
containing a sequence of extensions separated by the <code>#\:</code> character
for unixes or the <code>#\;</code> character for Windows.  Scheme systems may
initialize the sequence to include additional extensions.  Systems may have
mechanisms to cause the variable to be ignored.  Systems may have mechanisms to
reconfigure the sequence after it is initialized.</p>

<h3><a name="ordering-choosing">Ordering and Choosing</a></h3>

<p>The <i>ordering of matching files</i> is used to choose a file from a set of
available files matching a library name.  Multiple files might match a library
name because of multiple searched directories or multiple recognized file-name
extensions.  Scheme systems may have other mechanisms to choose auxiliary files
instead (e.g., compiled-code files) or different mechanisms to locate files for
libraries with names considered special (e.g., <code>(~ ---)</code> located in
users' home directory).  If, for a system, no such auxiliary file is available
and a library name is not considered special, the system must choose the
first-ordered file according to this SRFI.</p>

<p>Matches in a directory which is ordered before another directory are ordered
before matches in the other directory.  For matches in the same directory, a
match with an extension which is ordered before another extension is ordered
before a match with the other extension.</p>

       <dd><dl><dt>Given this sequence of searched-directory names:</dt>

<h1><a name="r6rs-library-files">R6RS Library Files</a></h1>

<p>R6RS systems which implement this SRFI must conform to the following
requirements.  Files with name extension <code>".s6l"</code>, which each
contain one library as an
<a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs/r6rs-Z-H-10.html#node_sec_7.1">
R6RS library form</a> as the first syntactic datum which the R6RS
<code>get-datum</code> procedure will read, must be supported.  The
<code>".s6l"</code> extension must be implicitly included in the sequence of
recognized file-name extensions, when the <code>SCHEME_LIB_EXTENSIONS</code>
environment variable is not defined.</p>

<p>R6RS systems which desire to support system-specific libraries are encouraged
to implicitly include, when <code>SCHEME_LIB_EXTENSIONS</code> is not defined, a
file-name extension of the form <code>".acme-s6l"</code>, substituting the
system's name for <code>"acme"</code>, and to order such extension before
<code>".s6l"</code>.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

<h1><a name="dialects-formats-extensions">Dialects, Formats, and Extensions</a></h1>

<p>Scheme is a family of dialects which use different file formats.  File-name
extensions which denote only that files are Scheme-related are not sufficient to
distinguish library-file types.  Extensions used for library-file names are
encouraged to precisely and unambiguously denote file types; i.e., distinct
dialects and formats are encouraged to have distinct extensions.  Such
extensions allow knowing the dialect/format/type of a file from its extension,
and they allow different types of same-library-name files to coexist.</p>

<p>Precise extensions may be utilized by Scheme systems which support multiple
dialects or file formats, to know how to handle different types of library files
which are simultaneously used.</p>

<p>Precise extensions assist users and applications working with library files,
by allowing them to know library-file types from library-file names.</p>

<p>Distinct extensions allow same-library-name files for different dialects to
be in the same directory.</p>

<p>Distinct extensions allow avoiding having same-library-name files for another
dialect shadow those for the desired dialect, when multiple dialects share the
searched directories.</p>
