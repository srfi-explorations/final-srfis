<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This SRFI defines an I/O layer for lazy, mostly functional buffered streams.</p><p>The layer architecture is similar to the upper three layers of the I/O subsystem in <a href="http://www.standardml.org/Basis/">The Standard ML Basis Library</a>.</p><p>In particular, this layer provides</p><ul><li>buffered reading and writing</li><li>arbitrary lookahead</li><li>dynamic redirection of input or output</li><li>binary and text I/O, mixed if needed</li><li>translated data streams</li><li>the ability to create I/O streams from arbitrary readers and writers </li></ul><p>It builds on the Primitive I/O  layer specified in <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-79/">SRFI 79 (Primitive I/O)</a>.</p><h1>Rationale</h1><p>The I/O subsystem in R5RS is too limited in many respects:  It only provides for text I/O, it only allows reading at the character and the datum level, and some of the primitives are mis-designed or underspecified.  As a result, almost every Scheme implementation has its own extensions to the I/O system, and rarely are two of these extensions compatible.</p><p>This SRFI is meant as one possible compelling replacement for the R5RS I/O subsystem.  As such, it is a completely new design, and it is not based on the extensions a particular existing Scheme system provides.  (In fact, it is probably, in its entirety, unlike what any existing Scheme system provides.)  Moreover, it is meant to be a substrate for further extensions which can be built on top of the subsystem via the interface described here.</p><p>The Port I/O layer specified in <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-81/">SRFI 81 (Port I/O)</a> provides an alternative such replacement.  The Port I/O layer is closer to R5RS.  However, the Stream I/O layer is more powerful and more expressive in several ways.</p><p>The design of this SRFI is driven by the requirements mentioned in the abstract on the one hand, and on the excellent design of the I/O subsystem in the Standard ML Basis Library. The latter is also the reason why this SRFI is different from the extensions provided by any existing Scheme implementation, as none of them picked up on the Basis design, and because the Basis design seems superior to the extensions I have looked at.  (Among those I have looked at are Scheme 48, scsh, Gambit-C, and PLT Scheme.)</p><p>Note, however, that this SRFI differs from the SML Basis in several important respects, among them the handling of textual I/O streams, the ability to define translated streams, and the absence of any functionality related to non-blocking I/O.  The latter is more properly in the domain of a thread/event system; Concurrent ML shows that the SML Basis plays well with such a system, and I expect the same to hold true here.  The text encoding/translation functionality is different mainly because it plays to a different substrate for representing text (based on Unicode; see below) than Standard ML.</p><p>Like the Standard ML Basis I/O subsystem, the I/O system specified in this SRFI is not suitable for maximal-throughput I/O, chiefly because it does not re-use buffers.  However, I deemed the achievable performance as more than adequate for most applications---it seemed a small price to pay for the convenient programming model.</p><h1>Specification</h1><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>This SRFI is meant for Scheme implementations with the following prerequisites:</p><ul><li><a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-34/">SRFI 34 (Exception Handling for Programs)</a></li><li><a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-35/">SRFI 35 (Conditions)</a></li><li><a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-74/">SRFI 74 (Octet-Addressed Binary Blocks)</a></li><li><a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-75/">SRFI 75 (R6RS Unicode data)</a></li><li><a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-79/">SRFI 79 (Primitive I/O)</a></li></ul><h2>Unicode support</h2><p>This SRFI assumes that the <code>char</code> datatype in Scheme corresponds to Unicode scalar values.  This, in turn, means that strings are represented as vectors of scalar values. (Note that this is consistent with <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-14/">SRFI 14 (Character-set library)</a> and <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-75/">SRFI 75 (R6RS Unicode data)</a>.) It may be possible to make this SRFI work in an ASCII- or Latin-1-only system, but I have not made any special provisions to ensure this.</p><h2>Filenames</h2><p>Filenames in this SRFI are the same as in <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-79/">SRFI 79 (Primitive I/O)</a>.</p><h2>General remarks</h2><p>For procedures that have no "natural" return value, this SRFI often uses the sentence</p><p><em>The return values are unspecified.</em></p><p>This means that number of return values  and the return values are unspecified.  However, the number of return values  is such that it is accepted by a continuation created by <code>begin</code>.  Specifically, on Scheme implementations where continuations created by <code>begin</code> accept an arbitrary number of arguments (this includes most implementations), it is suggested that the procedure return zero return values.</p><h2>Blobs</h2><p>The specification frequently refers to <i>blobs</i>.  These are as specified in <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-74/">SRFI 74 (Octet-Addressed Binary Blocks)</a>.</p><h2>File options</h2><p>File options are as in <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-79/">SRFI 79 (Primitive I/O)</a>.</p><h2>Buffer modes</h2><p>Each output stream has an associated <i>buffer mode</i> that defines when an output operation will flush the buffer associated with the output stream.  The possible buffer modes are <code>none</code> for no buffering, <code>line</code> for flushing upon newlines, and <code>block</code> for block-based buffering.</p><p>While this SRFI does not require buffer modes to form a distinct type, implementors are encouraged to make them a distinct type.</p><dl><dt><code>(buffer-mode </code><var>name</var><code>)</code> (syntax)</dt><dd><p><var>Name</var> must be one of the identifiers <code>none</code>, <code>line</code>, and <code>block</code>.  This returns a buffer-mode object denoting the associated buffer mode.  There is only one such object for each mode, so a program can compare them using <code>eq?</code>.</p></dd><dt><code>(buffer-mode? </code><var>obj</var><code>)</code></dt><dd><p>This returns <code>#t</code> if the argument is a buffer-mode object, <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p></dd></dl><h2>Text Transcoders</h2><p>Transcoders provide pre-packaged functionality for encoding and decoding text in some common encodings.  A <i>transcoder</i> is an opaque object encapsulating a specific text encoding.  This SRFI specifies how to obtain a transcoder given a text encoder/decoder (or <i>codec</i> for short) and a specified newline encoding.  Codecs are constructed by pairing up input and output stream translators.</p><dl><dt><code>(transcoder </code><code>(codec <var>codec</var>)</code> <code>(eol-style <var>eol-style</var>)</code><code>)</code> (syntax)</dt><dd><p>This constructs a transcoder object from a specified codec and a specified end-of-line style.  The <code>codec</code> and the <code>eol-style</code> clauses are both optional.  If present, <var>codec</var> and <var>eol-style</var>, must be expressions that evaluate to a codec and an eol-style object, respectively.  If not present, the codec defaults to "no codec" (corresponding to UTF-8), and the eol-style object defaults to the platform's standard EOL convention.</p><p>Any operands to a <code>transcoder</code> form that do not match the above syntax may be platform-specific extensions.  The implementation is free to ignore them, but must not signal an error.</p></dd><dt><code>(update-transcoder </code><var>old</var> <code>(codec <var>codec</var>)</code> <code>(eol-style <var>eol-style</var>)</code><code>)</code> (syntax)</dt><dd><p>This form returns a new transcoder object constructed from an old one, with the <code>codec</code> and <code>eol-style</code> fields replaced by the specified values.  (Again, the <code>codec</code> and the <code>eol-style</code> clauses are both optional.  Also, unrecognized operands can be ignored, but cannot signal an error.)</p></dd><dt><code>(eol-style </code><code>lf</code><code>)</code> (syntax)</dt><dt><code>(eol-style </code><code>crlf</code><code>)</code> (syntax)</dt><dt><code>(eol-style </code><code>cr</code><code>)</code> (syntax)</dt><dd><p>These forms evaluate to end-of-line-style objects - <code>lf</code> stands for using U+000A, <code>crlf</code> stands for using U+000D U+000A, and <code>cr</code> stands for using U+000D as end-of-line.</p></dd><dt><code>(make-codec </code><var>string</var> <var>translate-input</var> <var>translate-output</var> <var>initial-state</var><code>)</code></dt><dd><p>This constructs a codec object.  <var>String</var> must be a string naming the encoding.  <var>Translate-input</var> must be a translation procedure suitable for use by <a href="#make-translated-input-stream"><code>make-translated-input-stream</code></a>. <var>Translate-output</var> must be a translation procedure suitable for use by <a href="#make-translated-output-stream"><code>make-translated-output-stream</code></a>, and <var>initial-state</var> must be a suitable initial state.</p></dd><dt><code>latin-1-codec</code></dt><dt><code>utf-16le-codec</code></dt><dt><code>utf-16be-codec</code></dt><dt><code>utf-32le-codec</code></dt><dt><code>utf-32be-codec</code></dt><dd><p>These are predefined codecs for the ISO8859-1, UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, UTF32-LE, and UTF-32BE encodings.</p></dd></dl><h2>Input and Output Streams</h2><p>The Stream I/O layer defines high-level I/O operations on two new datatypes: <i>input streams</i> and <i>output streams</i>.  These operations include binary and textual I/O.  Input streams are treated in lazy functional style: input from a stream <var>s</var> yields an object representing the input itself, and a new  input stream <var>s1</var>.  <var>S</var> will continue to represent exactly the same position within the input; to advance within the stream, the program needs to perform input from <var>s1</var>.  Consequently, input streams allow arbitrary lookahead, which is especially convenient for all kinds of scanning.</p><p>Output streams are more conventional, as the lazy functional style does not make sense with output.</p><p>Both input streams and output streams are either directly connected to underlying readers and writers, or are defined by translation on an underlying stream.  This makes it possible to perform trivial transformations such as CR/LF translation, but also transparent recoding on the streams.</p><p>Textual I/O always uses UTF-8 as the underlying encoding.  Other encodings can easily be supported by translating to or from UTF-8 using the translation framework.  If a decoding error occurs, the implicit decoder will skip the octet starting the character encoding, yield a ? character, and attempt to continue decoding after that initial octet.</p><p>The Stream I/O layer adds an additional condition type to the condition types specified in <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-79/">SRFI 79 (Primitive I/O)</a>.</p><pre>(define-condition-type &amp;i/o-stream-error &amp;i/o-error
  i/o-stream-error?
  (stream i/o-error-stream))
</pre><p>The <code>stream</code> field has purely informational purpose.  Conditions raised in by Stream I/O procedures <em>may</em> include an <code>&amp;i/o-stream-error</code> condition, but are not required to do so.</p><h3>Input streams</h3><p>Input streams come in two flavors: either directly based on a reader, or based on another input stream via translation.  Input streams are in one of three states: active, truncated, or closed.  When initially created, a stream is active.  A program can retrieve the reader underlying an input stream---this automatically incurs disconnecting the stream from the reader, and puts the stream into the truncated state.  When explicitly closed, the reader underlying an open input stream is closed as well.  The closed state implies the truncated state.</p><p>Reading from a truncated stream is not an error; after all the existing buffers having been exhausted, the stream behaves as if an infinite sequence of end of files followed.</p><dl><dt><code>(input-stream? </code><var>obj</var><code>)</code></dt><dd><p>This returns <code>#t</code> if the argument is an input stream, <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p></dd><dt><a name="input-blob-some"><code>(input-blob-some </code><var>input-stream</var><code>)</code></a></dt><dd><p>This returns two values: a value and another input stream.  The input stream returned points exactly past the data read. If any data is available before the next end of file, this returns a freshly allocated blob of non-zero size containing that data.  If an end of file has been reached, the value is <code>#f</code>, and the input stream returned points just past the end of file.  This procedure will block until either data is available or end of file is reached.</p></dd><dt><a name="input-u8"><code>(input-u8 </code><var>input-stream</var><code>)</code></a></dt><dd><p>This returns two values: a value and another input stream.  The input stream returned points exactly past the data read. If an octet is available before the next end of file, this returns that octet as an exact integer.  If an end of file has been reached, the value is <code>#f</code>, and the input stream returned points just past the end of file.

If fewer octets are available before the next end of file, it returns a blob containing those octets. The input stream returned points exactly past the data read.

If <var>count</var> or more octets are available before the next end of file, they are written into <var>blob</var> starting at index <var>start</var>, and it returns <var>count</var> as the value.

The problem with this approach is that the encoding/decoding defines a mapping from binary data to text or vice versa.  Because of this asymmetry, such mappings do not compose.  The result is usually complications and restrictions in the I/O API, such as the inability to mix text or binary data.</p><p>This SRFI avoids this problem by specifying that textual I/O always uses UTF-8.  This means that, if the target or source of an I/O stream is to use a different encoding, a translated stream needs to be used, for which this SRFI offers the required facilities.  This means that text decoders or encoders are expressed as binary-to-binary mappings, and as such compose.</p><h3>No distinct end of file object</h3><p>In R5RS, the distinct type of end of file objects is primarily for the benefit of <code>read</code>, where end of file must be denoted by an object that <code>read</code> cannot normally return as a result of parsing the input.  However, it does not seem necessary to drag in the complications of this separate object into the other I/O operations, where <code>#f</code> is perfectly adequate to represent end of file.</p><h1>Reference Implementation</h1><p><a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-79/srfi-79.tgz">Here</a> is a tarball containing a reference implementation of this SRFI, along with implementations for <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-79/">SRFI 79 (Primitive I/O)</a>, <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-81/">SRFI 81 (Port I/O)</a>, and <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-82/">SRFI 82 (Stream-Port I/O)</a>.  It only runs on a version of Scheme 48 that has not been released at the time of writing in this SRFI.</p><p>However, its actual dependencies on Scheme 48 idiosyncracies are few.  Chief are its use of the module system, which is easily replaced by another, and the implementation of Unicode.  To implement primitive readers and writers on files, the code only relies on suitable library procedures to open the files, and <code>read-byte</code> and <code>write-byte</code> procedures to read or write single bytes from a (R5RS) port, as well as a <code>force-output</code> procedure to flush a port.</p><p>The reference implementation has not been highly tuned, but I have spent a modest amount of time making the code deal with buffers in an economic buffer.  Because of this, the code is more complicated than it needs to be, but hopefully also more usable as a basis for implementing this SRFI in actual Scheme systems.</p><h1>Examples</h1><p>Many examples are adapted from <a href="http://www.standardml.org/Basis/">The Standard ML Basis Library</a> edited by Emden R.
