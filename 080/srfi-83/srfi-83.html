<p>
   This SRFI is being submitted by members of the Scheme Language
   Editor's Committee as part of the R6RS Scheme standardization
   process.  The purpose of such ``R6RS SRFIs'' is to inform the
   Scheme community of features and design ideas under consideration
   by the editors and to allow the community to give the editors some
   direct feedback that will be considered during the design process.
</p>
<p>
   At the end of the discussion period, this SRFI will be withdrawn.
   When the R6RS specification is finalized, the SRFI may be revised
   to conform to the R6RS specification and then resubmitted with the
   intent to finalize it.  This procedure aims to avoid the situation
   where this SRFI is inconsistent with R6RS.  An inconsistency
   between R6RS and this SRFI could confuse some users.  Moreover it
   could pose implementation problems for R6RS compliant Scheme
   systems that aim to support this SRFI.  Note that departures from
   the SRFI specification by the Scheme Language Editor's Committee
   may occur due to other design constraints, such as design
   consistency with other features that are not under discussion as
   SRFIs.

<!-- ABSTRACT -->

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>The module system presented here is designed to let programmers
share libraries, i.e., code that is intended to be incorporated into
larger programs, and especially into programs that use library code
from multiple sources. The module system supports macro definitions
within modules, allows macro exports, and distinguishes the phases in
which definitions and imports are needed. This SRFI defines a standard
notation for libraries, a semantics for library expansion and
execution, and a simple format for sharing libraries.</p>

<!-- ISSUES -->

<h1>Issues</h1>

<ul>

 <li> <p>The <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> forms could
      be allowed in macro expansions. In that case, the exports and imports
      of a module can be determined only by macro-expanding the
      module.</p>

 <li> <p>Better support for records may be useful, possibly through a
      <code>co-export</code> form:
      <code>(co-export&nbsp;&lt;co-spec&gt;*)</code>, where
      <code>&lt;co-spec&gt;</code> contains an identifier defined or
      imported into a library followed by a list of other identifiers
      defined or imported into the library:</p>

<pre>
 &lt;co-spec&gt; = (&lt;identifier&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;*)
</pre>

      <p>The meaning of a <code>&lt;co-spec&gt;</code> is that if the
      first identifier becomes exported, either through
      <code>export</code> or <code>co-export</code>, then the
      remaining identifiers are also exported.  Similarly, if the
      first identifier is indirectly exported through
      <code>indirect-export</code> or <code>co-export</code>, then
      then remaining identifiers are indirectly exported.</p>

      <p>To be useful for managing records, probably
      <code>co-export</code> must be allowed in macro expansions. In
      that case, the full exports of a module can be determined only
      by macro-expanding the module.</p>

 <li> <p>Instead of having the programmer declare import phases with
       <code>(for .... expand)</code>, etc., phases could be inferred
       from uses of the imported identifiers. In that case,
       determining the phase of an import would require macro-expanding
       the module body.</p>

 <li> <p>The specification for library references should probably
      include versioning. Without any change to the SRFI, we could say
      that a version is part of a library's name in the universal
      namespace, in which case every library reference selects a
      specific version. A better system would allow specifications
      such as "major version N, minor version of M or later", etc. In
      this case, a <code>&lt;lib-path&gt;</code> must be resolved to a
      specific library name (including the version) based on the
      available versions.</p>

</ul>

<!-- RATIONALE -->

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>This standard addresses the following specific goals:</p>
<ul>

 <li> <b>Separate compilation and analysis</b>; no two libraries have
   to be compiled at the same time (i.e., the meanings of two
   libraries cannot depend on each other cyclically, and compilation of two
   different libraries cannot rely on state shared across
   compilations), and significant program analysis does not require a
   whole program.

 <li> <b>Independent compilation/analysis of unrelated libraries</b>,
   where ``unrelated'' means that neither depends on the other through
   a transitive closure of imports.

 <li> <b>Explicit declaration of dependencies</b>, so that the meaning
   of each identifier is clear at compile time, and so that there is
   no ambiguity about whether a library needs to be executed for
   another library's compile time and/or run time.

 <li> <b>Namespace management</b>, so that different library producers are
   unlikely to define the same top-level name.

</ul>

<p>It does not address the following:</p>

<ul>

 <li> Mutually dependent libraries.

 <li> Separation of library interface from library implementation.

 <li> Code outside of a library (e.g., <code>5</code> by itself as a
      program).

 <li> Local modules and local imports.

</ul>

<!-- SPECIFICATION -->

<h1>Specification</h1>

<h2>Library Form</h2>

<p>A library declaration contains the following elements:</p>
<ul>

 <li> a name for the library (possibly relative) within the universal
      space of library names

 <li> a list of import dependencies (including a distinguished "language"
      import), where each dependency specifies the following:
      <ul>
      <li>the imported library's name
      <li>the relevant phase: run time or expand time
      <li>the subset of the library's exports to make available within the 
          importing library, and the local names to use within the importing library
          for each of the library's exports
      </ul>

 <li> a list of exports, which name a subset of the library's imports
      and definitions

 <li> a sequence of variable definitions, macro definitions,
      indirect export declarations, and expressions;
      indirect export declarations name unexported identifiers that
      might appear in a locally defined macro's expansion.</ul>

<!-- Library Form Syntax -->

<a name="syntax"></a><h3>Library Form Syntax</h3>

<p>A library definition is written with the
<code>library</code> form:</p>

<pre>
   (library &lt;lib-path&gt; &lt;language&gt;
     &lt;body&gt;)
</pre>

<p>The syntax of <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> depends on the
specific <code>&lt;language&gt;</code>. An implementation may allow a
reference to another library as a <code>&lt;language&gt;</code>, but
this SRFI defines only the behavior when <code>&lt;language&gt;</code>
is <code>"scheme://r6rs"</code>. Future standards may define the meaning of other
<code>&lt;language&gt;</code> forms, but it is expected that <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
will follow Scheme's lexical conventions, so that <code>read</code> can process
any <code>library</code> declaration.</p>

<table width="80%" align="center" bgcolor="#999999"><tr><td>
Example:
<pre>
  (library "hello" "scheme://r6rs"
    (display "Hello World")
    (newline))

</pre>
</td></tr></table>

<p>For <code>"scheme://r6rs"</code> as <code>&lt;language&gt;</code>, the
grammar of <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> is as follows:</p>

<pre>
 &lt;body&gt; = &lt;impexp-form&gt;* &lt;comdef-form&gt;*

 &lt;impexp-form&gt; = (import &lt;import-spec&gt;*)
               | (export &lt;export-spec&gt;*)

 &lt;comdef-form&gt; = &lt;command or definition&gt;
               | (indirect-export &lt;indirect-spec&gt;*)
               | (begin &lt;comdef-form&gt;*)
               | &lt;derived-comdef&gt;
</pre>

<p>The <code>import</code> form imports bindings into the library, and
the <code>export</code> form exports bindings from the library. A
<code>&lt;command or definition&gt;</code> introduces a local
definition or executes an expression for its side-effects, and the
grammar for <code>&lt;command or definition&gt;</code> is the same as
in R5RS. No identifier can be imported multiple times, defined
multiple times, or both defined and imported.  The
<code>indirect-export</code> form declares that certain macros might
expand to uses of certain unexported bindings.</p> A
<code>&lt;derived-comdef&gt;</code> is a macro call that expands into
a <code>&lt;comdef&gt;</code>.

<p>An <code>&lt;import-spec&gt;</code> imports bindings for
use at a specific <b>phase</b>:</p>

<pre>
 &lt;import-spec&gt; = &lt;import-set&gt;
               | (for &lt;import-set&gt; &lt;import-phase&gt;*)
 &lt;import-phase&gt; = run
                | expand
</pre>

<p>An unadorned <code>&lt;import-set&gt;</code> imports for run
 time. A <code>for</code> form imports for either run time, expansion
 time, or both. The listed <code>&lt;import-phase&gt;</code>s must
 be distinct.</p>

<p>An <code>&lt;export-spec&gt;</code> is merely an
<code>&lt;export-set&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre>
 &lt;export-spec&gt; = &lt;export-set&gt;
</pre>

<p>An <code>&lt;indirect-spec&gt;</code> contains an identifier for a
macro defined in this library followed by a list of other identifiers
that are defined within this library:</p>

<pre>
 &lt;indirect-spec&gt; = (&lt;identifier&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;*)
</pre>

<p>The meaning of an <code>&lt;indirect-spec&gt;</code> is that the
expansion of a macro bound to the first identifier can contain
references to the remaining identifiers. If the first identifier is
exported from the library, then the other identifiers are potentially
accessible outside the library. If an identifier is not exported and
not indirectly exported with an exported macro, then accessing the
identifier from outside the library signals an error. (If access is
possible at all, then it is only possible through a macro whose
expansion is inconsistent with the declaration of indirect exports.) If
the first <code>&lt;identifier&gt;</code> in an
<code>&lt;indirect-spec&gt;</code> is not defined as a macro within
the library, or if any of the other <code>&lt;identifiers&gt;</code>s
is not defined within the library, then an error is signalled.</p>

<p>An <code>&lt;import-set&gt;</code> names a set of bindings from
another library, and gives them local names for the importing
libraries:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;import-set&gt; = &lt;lib-path&gt;
               | (only &lt;<i>X</i>-set&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;*)
               | (except &lt;<i>X</i>-set&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;*)
               | (add-prefix &lt;<i>X</i>-set&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;)
               | (rename &lt;<i>X</i>-set&gt; (&lt;identifier&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;)*)
</pre>

<p>The ultimate <code>&lt;lib-path&gt;</code> names the exports of a
   particular library. Initially, the internal names for the imports are the same
   as the external names from the exporting library, and forms such as
   <code>add-prefix</code> and <code>rename</code> adjust the internal
   set of internal names. More specifically: </p>
<ul>

 <li> The <code>only</code> form produces a subset of the bindings
      from another <code>&lt;<i>X</i>-set&gt;</code>, including only
      the listed internal (external) <code>&lt;identifier&gt;</code>s;
      if any of the included <code>&lt;identifier&gt;</code>s is not
      in <code>&lt;<i>X</i>-set&gt;</code>, an error is reported.

 <li> The <code>except</code> form produces a subset of the bindings
      from another <code>&lt;<i>X</i>-set&gt;</code>, including all but
      the listed internal (external) <code>&lt;identifier&gt;</code>s;
      if any of the excluded <code>&lt;identifier&gt;</code>s is not
      in <code>&lt;<i>X</i>-set&gt;</code>, an error is reported.

 <li> The <code>add-prefix</code> adds a prefix to each internal
      (external) name from another <code>&lt;<i>X</i>-set&gt;</code>.

 <li> The <code>rename</code> form, for each pair of identifiers 
       <code>(&lt;identifier&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;)</code>, removes a binding from the set from
       <code>&lt;<i>X</i>-set&gt;</code>, and adds it back with a
       different internal (external) name. The first
       <code>identifier</code> is the original internal (external)
       name, and the second <code>identifier</code> is the new
       internal (external) name. If the original name is not in
       <code>&lt;<i>X</i>-set&gt;</code>, or if the new name is
       already in <code>&lt;<i>X</i>-set&gt;</code>, an error is
       reported.

</ul>

<p>An <code>&lt;export-set&gt;</code> names a set of imported and locally
defined bindings, and gives them external names for exporting:</p>

<pre>
 &lt;export-set&gt; = &lt;identifier&gt;
              | (rename (&lt;identifier&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;)*)

</pre>

<p>In an <code>&lt;export-set&gt;</code>, an
   <code>&lt;identifier&gt;</code> names a single binding defined
   within the library or imported, where the
   external name for the export is the same as the name of
   the binding within the library. A <code>rename</code> set exports the binding
   named by the first <code>&lt;identifier&gt;</code> in each pair, using
   the second <code>&lt;identifier&gt;</code> as the external
   name.</p>

<!-- Library Macro Expansion -->

<a name="expand"></a><h3>Library Macro Expansion</h3>

<p>For each <code>import</code> form, all imported bindings are
available for processing of
<code>&lt;comdef-form&gt;</code>s. Variables and macros imported into
the expand-time phase with <code>(for ....  expand)</code> are
available for use within macro definitions. More precisely, libraries
imported for run time must be <b>visited</b> (see <a
href="#semantics">Library Semantics</a>) if they have not been visited
already, and libraries imported for expand time with <code>(for ....
expand)</code> must be <b>invoked</b> (see <a
href="#semantics">Library Semantics</a>) if they have not been invoked
already.</p>

<p>To discover macro definitions within the library,
<code>&lt;comdef-form&gt;</code>s are partially expanded first to
last; expansion proceeds only far enough to determine whether it is a
definition, <code>begin</code> form, or something else. If the
<code>&lt;comdef-form&gt;</code> is a macro definition, then the macro
becomes available for use in expanding later
<code>&lt;comdef-form&gt;</code>s. If the
<code>&lt;comdef-form&gt;</code> is a <code>begin</code> form, the
content forms are sliced into the library top-level in place of the
<code>begin</code> form, and partial expansion proceeds with the newly
spliced forms.</p>

<p>After all macro definitions have been discovered, macro expansion
resumes for each <code>&lt;comdef-form&gt;</code>,
using all discovered macros. In this way, macros defined later can be
used to generate non-definition <code>&lt;comdef-form&gt;</code>s or
used on the right-hand side of definition
<code>&lt;comdef-form&gt;</code>s. An error is signalled if expansion
of a <code>&lt;comdef-form&gt;</code> produces a definition in this
second phase (i.e., expansion requires a macro defined later in the
library to produce a definition form).

<p>Macro expansion obeys lexical scope in the sense that if a macro
expansion introduces a identifier that is bound in the context of the
macro definition, it refers to the binding in the environment of the
macro-definition library, not in the environment of the expansion.</p>

<p>An error is signalled if a macro expands to an
<code>&lt;impexp-form&gt;</code>; all imports and exports must be
apparent before macro expansion, and they must appear before any
<code>&lt;comdef-form&gt;</code>. A <code>indirect-export</code> form,
in contrast, can appear in a macro expansion.</p>

<p>To avoid ambiguity, no local
identifier can be imported or defined multiple times.</p>

<!-- Library Semantics -->

<a name="semantics"></a><h3>Library Semantics</h3>

<p>Since a library contains a sequence of definitions and expressions, a
library can be used as an application. Alternately, a Scheme program
standard (not part of this SRFI) may refer to libraries to be executed
as part of the program. In either case, executing the library must
imply executing any library that it imports.</p>

<p>More formally, we define library execution in terms of
<b>invoking</b> libraries. To execute a library, invoke it at phase
0.</p>

<p>To <b>invoke</b> a library at phase <i>N</i>:</p>
<ul>

 <li> Invoke at phase <i>N</i> any library that is imported by this
 library for run time, and that is not yet invoked at phase <i>N</i>.

 <li> Evaluate all variable definitions and top-level expressions
 within the library. (Macro definitions are not evaluated.)

</ul>
<p>
The order in which imported libraries are invoked is not defined,
but imported libraries must be invoked before the library's definitions
and top-level expressions are evaluated.
</p>

<p>As noted in <a href="#expand">Library Macro Expansion</a>,
compiling a library implies <b>visiting</b> some libraries that it
imports, as well as invoking others. Specifically, compiling a library
requires the same action as visiting the library at phase 0.</p>

<p>To <b>visit</b> a library at phase <i>N</i>:</p>
<ul>

 <li> Visit at phase <i>N</i> any library that is imported by this
 library for run time, and that is not yet visited at phase <i>N</i>.

 <li> Invoke at phase <i>N</i>+1 any library that is imported by this
 library <code>for .... expand</code>, and that is not yet invoked at phase
 <i>N</i>+1.

 <li> Evaluate all syntax definitions within the library. (Top-level
 expressions are not evaluated, and the right-hand sides of variable
 definitions are not evaluated.)

</ul>
<p>
The order in which imported libraries are visited and invoked is not defined,
but imported libraries must be visited and invoked before the library's 
syntax definitions are evaluated.
</p>

<p>
An error is signalled if an identifier is used out of its declared phase(s).
</p>

<!-- Library References -->

<h2>Library References</h2>

<p>A library refers to another library through a
<code>&lt;lib-path&gt;</code>. Conceptually, a
<code>&lt;lib-path&gt;</code> is a name within a universal
space. Library names in the universe are arranged in a tree, so that a
<code>&lt;lib-path&gt;</code> can be relative, much like a filesystem
path or URL.</p>

<p>A <code>&lt;lib-path&gt;</code> is therefore represented by a
hierarchical URI string (see RFC 2396) or a symbol shortcut (defined
below). The URI scheme ``scheme'' should be used to refer to libraries
that are released by the Scheme community at large, in much the same
way that a Java package name is used. For example,
<code>"scheme://acme.com/wiley/quicksort"</code> might refer to a
quicksort library that is distributed by Wiley at Acme. If Wiley's
quicksort library contains the <code>&lt;lib-path&gt;</code>
<code>"utils"</code>, it can be expanded as
<code>"scheme://acme.com/wiley/utils"</code>.</p>

<p>The URI <code>"scheme://r6rs"</code> must be supported by every
implementation, and it must export all bindings in R5RS, plus
<code>import</code>, <code>export</code>, and
<code>indirect-export</code>. URIs starting with
<code>"scheme://r<i>N</i>rs"</code> and
<code>"scheme://srfi-<i>N</i>"</code> are reserved for definition by
standards processes.

<p>The way that URIs for library references are mapped to
<code>library</code> declarations is
implementation-specific. Implementations might, for example, interpret
a ``http'' URI as a reference to library within a UTF-8-encoded
package on the web. The resolution of a relative
<code>&lt;lib-path&gt;</code> for a library name (as in the examples
of <a href="#syntax">Library Form Syntax</a>) is also
implementation-dependent, but by convention, sequences of declarations
with relative names (again, as in ) are all relative to the same
(unspecified) absolute name.</p>

<p>This SRFI defines no interaction between <code>library</code> and
the <code>eval</code> and <code>load</code> procedures. Programmers
should not expect that an <code>eval</code> or <code>load</code> that
appears with a <code>library</code> body either references or extends
the definitions within the <code>library</code>.</p>

<p>This SRFI also does not require that implementations support a mode
to evaluate <code>library</code> forms interactively. An
implementation's native module form might be completely different from
<code>library</code>, and the implementation may simply supply a tool
to translate packaged libraries into the implementation's native
format.</p>

<!-- REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION -->

<h1>Reference Implementation</h1>

<p>A reference implementation for PLT Scheme 299.200 supports
<code>library</code> forms in the MzScheme REPL, and also a way to install a
set of <code>library</code> declarations into the usual PLT Scheme
module space (by splitting the <code>library</code> sequence into
separate files, adding <code>#reader(lib "library.ss" "r6rs")</code>
to the top of each file).</p>

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>
This SRFI was written in consultation with the full set of R6RS
editors: Will Clinger, Kent Dybvig, Marc Feeley, Matthew Flatt, Manuel Serrano,
Michael Sperber, and Anton van Straaten.
