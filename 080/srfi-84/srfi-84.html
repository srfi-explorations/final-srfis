<H1>Abstract</H1>

<p>This SRFI proposes a social convention to allow programmers to
easily create short, simple Scheme symbols which are guaranteed to be
universally unique: No other programmer also following this SRFI will
accidentally create a symbol eq? to yours.

<p>Universally unique symbols are useful to identify standards,
languages, libraries, types, classes, and other resources.


<H1>Issues</H1>

<ul>

<li><p>This SRFI is unusual in that it discusses an issue raised by
two other SRFI's... which themselves are going to be withdrawn as part
of the R6RS standards process.

<p>The issue of universal identifiers seemed large enough to me to
make it useful to pull the topic into its own SRFI where it could be
discussed separately from what SRFI-76 and SRFI-83 are mainly focused
on...  but that does leave open the question of how we (or, I should
say, the SRFI editors) would reach the point of deciding whether this
SRFI should be finalized or withdrawn.

<li>Versioning of resources (such as libraries) is an important issue,
but is not addressed here in this SRFI.

<li>What more rules do we need so that a universal identifier created
by following this SRFI can be read into any conforming R6RS Scheme
implementation without quoting?

<li>There is as yet no way to register an open source library at
schemers.org.

<li>It would be nice to have a proof that no identifier can be created
using one method that is the same as an identifier created by another
method.  Would any theorists like to take this on?

</ul>


<H1>Rationale</H1>

<p>Universal identifiers feature in a couple recent SRFI proposals.
The 2005-10-17 draft of <a
href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-76/srfi-76.html">SRFI-76</a>: R6RS
Records recommends using UUID's (<a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt">RFC 4122</a>) to uniquely
identify non-generative records, and the 2005-11-30 draft of <a
href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-83/srfi-83.html">SRFI-83</a>: R6RS
Library Syntax uses a URI (<a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">RFC 2396</a>) to identify
the R6RS language.

<p>While URI's and UUID's are adequate for providing computers with
unambiguous identifiers, people also have needs with respect to
universal identifiers that I suggest can be better met with the
alternative described here.


<h2>Why Not URI's?</h2>

<p>The URI syntax is more complex than we need.  (Without going to
look, is the identifier in SRFI-83 for R6RS "scheme://r6rs/" or is it
"scheme://r6rs"?)

<p>URI's also don't give you guidance for constructing your own
unique identifier.  (You've written a library.  Quick!  Come up with
an URI that's short, easy to type, and you <i>know</i> no one else is
using).


<h2>Why Not UUID's?</h2>

<p>UUID's are great for computers.  Your average computer can generate
10 million UUID's in a second and every one is guaranteed to be
different from any other UUID.

<p>But they're not so great for people.  (Quick!  Is
urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6 the same or different
than the example UUID found in the middle of page 4 of <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt">RFC 4122</a>?)

<p>And people are important.  We copy and paste code.  We look at
libraries and try to figure out why they are colliding when they
shouldn't be.

<p>It's easy to <i>say</i> that one should use UUID's correctly, but
we also can look at what people have had trouble with in practice:
consider the experience of using the Microsoft Windows installer,
which uses UUID's to track the components of installed programs.  It's
a great hassle when you've updated your component's UUID's when you
weren't supposed to, or not updated your UUID's when you should, and
now the Window's installer is broken...

<p>The Java, Perl, Python, and Ruby communities all manage a large
namespace of code, and they avoid collisions through social
conventions instead of using machine generated unique identifiers.


<h2>Use Symbols For Identifiers</h2>

<p>Lisp languages and Scheme have an elegant property that "two
symbols are identical if and only if they are spelled the same way"
[<a
href="http://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-9.html#%_sec_6.3.3">R5RS</a>].

<p>This makes symbols ideal for universal identifiers, instead of
using strings or some other type.


<h2>Make the Names of Important Standards Really Short</h2>

<p>As I mentioned above, the <a
href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-83/srfi-83.html">SRFI-83</a> R6RS
Library Syntax draft of 2005-10-31 proposes that the identifier for
R6RS be:

<blockquote><p>"scheme://r6rs"</blockquote>

<p>(look, no slash at the end...)

<p>Many millions of people in future generations will be using Scheme,
so we want to make this <i>really easy</i>.  This SRFI proposes
that the universal identifier for R6RS be simply instead:

<blockquote><p>r6rs</blockquote>


<h2>Libraries Organized by Category</h2>

<p>Many popular open source library collections are organized by
category, sometimes with subcategories within the category, and then
libraries within the (sub)category.

<p>Looking forward to the time that we have a large body of reusable
libraries that can be used in any R6RS implementation, this SRFI
proposes and reserves a naming system for public libraries:

<blockquote><p>web:server:spiffy
<br>web:server:plt
<br>web:servlet:kawa
<br>...
</blockquote>

<p>Such a naming system will require community support, such as through
<a href="http://schemers.org">schemers.org</a>, to allow people to
register the names of their libraries.


<h2>Domain Names</h2>

<p>Many projects, groups, and businesses have registered their own
domain name.  Your domain name is a natural choice to use as the base
for your universal identifier... when, of course, the the domain is
relevant to the resource you are naming.

<blockquote><p>call-with-current-continuation.org
<br>plt-scheme.org
<br>...
</blockquote>


<h2>HTTP URL's</h2>

<p>Many people and projects, even if they don't have their own domain
name, do have their own home page on the web.

<blockquote><p>http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SLIB.html
<br>http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/
<br>...
</blockquote>

<p>This SRFI supports using HTTP URL's as the base of a universal
identifier when that is convenient.


<h2>Building Upon the Base</h2>

<p>Once you have selected a base unique identifier which is simple,
convenient, and easy to read for your resource, more unique
identifiers can be easily constructed.

<blockquote><p>web:server:plt::request-type
<br>plt-scheme.org::drscheme
<br>http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SLIB.html::solid
</blockquote>

<p>The rules of this SRFI guarantee that none of these different schemes
will clash with each other.


<h2>Now Use It</h2>

<p>This SRFI is designed so that any universal identifier constructed
following these rules can be read into any conforming R6RS
implementation and used as an identifier without needing to be quoted
with the vertical bar (|) syntax.



<H1>Specification</H1>

<p>A universal identifier is a Scheme symbol that has a base part and an
optional extension.

<pre>
  &lt;universal-identifier&gt; = &lt;base-part&gt;
                         | &lt;base-part&gt; :: &lt;extension&gt;
</pre>

<p>The "::", if present, is part of the symbol, as if the symbol were
created by:

<pre>
    (string->symbol (string-append base-part "::" extension))
</pre>

<p>The base part is something that you own and is unique to you.  The
extension can be whatever you like, as long as the resulting universal
identifier can be read into an R6RS implementation without quoting.

<h2>Valid Identifiers</h2>

<p>To be valid, a universal identifier must be a name that can be used
as a Scheme identifier and does not need to be quoted with the
vertical bar (|) character:

<ul>
<li>A zero length name is disallowed.
<li>The name may not start with a character that can start a number.
<li>The name may not contain whitespace, the vertical bar (|) character, or
the backslash (\) character.
</ul>

<p>Note that this disallows some base-part's that could otherwise be
constructed, such as some HTTP URL's.

<h2>Base-Part Options</h2>

<p>You may choose whichever kind of base part that
is most convenient for you:

<pre>
  &lt;base-part&gt; = &lt;open-source-library&gt;
              | &lt;rNrs&gt;
              | &lt;srfi-N&gt;
              | &lt;domain-name&gt;
              | &lt;http-url&gt;

</pre>

<p>Restrictions and requirements for each kind of base part are
described here.

<ul>

<li>
  <p><b>open-source-library</b>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Syntax: <code>name ( ":" name )+</code>
    <p>Requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>You are an author of this open source library registered at
      schemers.org.
    </ul>

    <p>Example:
    <blockquote><p>games:adventure:colossal-cave</blockquote>

    <p>Restrictions:
    <ul>
      <li>The name may not contain slash (/) or period (.) characters.
      <li>The name must contain at least one colon (:) character.
      <li>The name may not begin with a character that can start a number.
    </ul>

    <p>Recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>Use lower case letters for the name.
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

<li>
  <p><b>rNrs</b>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Syntax: <code>rNrs</code>, where N is a positive integer.

    <p>Requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>You are a member of the Scheme Language Editor's Committee.
    </ul>

    <p>Example:
    <blockquote><p>r6rs</blockquote>
  </blockquote>

<li>
  <p><b>srfi-N</b>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Syntax: <code>srfi-N</code>, where N is a positive integer.

    <p>Requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>You are an author of the SRFI.
    </ul>

    <p>Example:
    <blockquote><p>srfi-75</blockquote>
  </blockquote>

<li>
  <p><b>domain-name</b>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Syntax: See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">RFC 1035</a>.

    <p>Requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>You own the domain name.
    </ul>

    <p>Example:
    <blockquote><p>schemers.org</blockquote>

    <p>Recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>Write the domain name in lower case.
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

<li>
  <p><b>http-url</b>


  <blockquote>
    <p>Syntax: See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt">RFC 1738</a>.
    
    <p>Requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>The scheme is "http", and
      <li>an http GET operation on the URL returns content, and
      <li>you own the content.
    </ul>

    <p>Example:
    <blockquote><p>http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SLIB.html</blockquote>

    <p>Restrictions:
    <ul>
      <li>The URL path must not contain unencoded ::, \, or |
      character sequences.
    </ul>

    <p>Recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>Write the hostname part in lower case.
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</ul>


<H1>Implementation</H1>

<p>No code is needed to use this SRFI.

<p>The following code (R5RS with SRFI-13: String Libraries and
SRFI-14: Character-set Library) may be used to check if a universal
identifier has a correct form and can be used unquoted in R6RS Scheme
implementations.

<p>It does not check whether domain names are legal domain names or if
HTTP URL's are valid URL's.
