<H1>Abstract</H1>

<p>Over the past ten years, numerous libraries have been specified via
the Scheme Requests for Implementation process.  Yet until the recent
ratification of the Revised<sup>6</sup> Report on the Algorithmic
Language Scheme, there has been no standardized way of distributing or
relying upon library code.  Now that such a library system exists,
there is a real need to organize these existing SRFI libraries so that
they can be portably referenced.</p>

<p>This SRFI is designed to facilitate the writing and distribution of
code that relies on SRFI libraries.  It identifies a subset of
existing SRFIs that specify features amenable to provision (and
possibly implementation) as libraries (SRFI Libraries) and proposes a
naming convention for this subset so that these libraries may be
referred to by name or by number.  Moreover, portable R<sup>6</sup>RS reference
implementations and test suites are provided, where possible, for the
SRFI Libraries.</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

<ul>
<li>Some authors have already specified the names that should be used
(e.g., list-lib for SRFI 1 and vector-lib for SRFI 43) for Schemes with
a library system, however these names are not used here.  SRFI 41
Streams is the only SRFI to specify an R<sup>6</sup>RS library and therefore it
specifies its library names.  These names are not used here.  In both
cases, a consistent naming scheme is used which happens to differ from
the author's originally chosen names.  (Note that most
implementations, which do have some kind of library system, do not
follow the author recommendations for names in existing SRFIs.)</li>

<li>This SRFI uses <code>(srfi <em>N</em>)</code>, but this is not
allowed in R<sup>6</sup>RS, even though it is consistent with the
R<sup>6</sup>RS recommendation that library names be suitable as part
of file names (indeed, numbers are used in the versioning component of
library names).  So if there is a consensus that this <em>should</em>
be the way to reference SRFIs, I'm willing to make a de facto
extension of R<sup>6</sup>RS that allows for this.  Other alternatives
include <code>(srfi-<em>N</em>)</code>, which is non-hierarchical and
thus violates the recommendations of R<sup>6</sup>RS on choosing
library names and may cause some ugliness when systems map names to a
file system location and all the srfis appear in the root directory.
Other options include <code>(srfi nN *)</code>, <code>(org
schemers srfi-N *)</code>, <code>(srfis srfi-N *)</code>, etc.  All of
these are, in my opinion, ugly hacks around R<sup>6</sup>RS
limitations.</li>

<li>Some SRFIs are omitted on the grounds that they alter the
semantics of standard Scheme bindings (e.g., SRFI 70, Numbers).  It is
possible that these SRFIs could be provided as libraries that
effectively supersede <code>(rnrs base)</code> by exporting the same
bindings as <code>(rnrs base)</code>, but with the altered semantics.
Combining several such SRFIs would not work as intended, but it may be
a sensible alternative to omission.  On the other hand, this might be
seen as a perversion of the original author's intent that these
semantics really be the semantics of the standard bindings.</li>

<li>Some SRFIs are omitted on the grounds that they alter or extend
the lexical syntax of Scheme programs, which cannot be provided by an
R<sup>6</sup>RS library (see next issue).  However, extensions to
lexical syntax could be part of a SRFI library so long as that library
(or some other library) also exports procedures that implement the
extended syntax.  In other words, extensions to the lexical syntax of
the standard read and write procedures cannot be part of a SRFI
library, but nonstandard read and write procedures are okay.  SRFI 38
does this.  Should this approach be adopted in general?</li>

<li>R6RS allows for lexical extension via <code>#!&lt;identifier&gt;</code>
lexemes.  Should this SRFI incorporate those SRFIs that are excluded
for extending the lexical syntax and define the appropriate
<code>#!srfi-N</code> lexeme?</li>

<li>Some omitted SRFIs may be implemented as libraries
(eg. Conditions), but have been omitted because they are subsumed by
R<sup>6</sup>RS, or are don't make much sense without other SRFIs which cannot be
implemented as libraries (such as Exception Handling for Programs).
Should these SRFIs be included?</li>

<li>Is SRFI 44, Collections, really a SRFI Library?  It's more of a
meta-SRFI than a library.</li>

<li>SRFI 4, Homogeneous numeric vector datatypes, has a substantial
library component but also modifies the lexical syntax of the
language.  Should it be considered a SRFI Library?</li>

<li>Should export levels be specified?</li>

<li>Withdrawn SRFIs are not considered here. Should they be?</li>

<li>Versioning information is not included in the library naming
scheme.  This SRFI does not specify the meaning of importing SRFI
libraries declared with versioning information.</li>

<li>ERR<sup>5</sup>RS: My hope is that this SRFI carries over without issue to
ERR<sup>5</sup>RS.  But someone who knows more about the library system of ERR<sup>5</sup>RS
will have to evaluate this.</li>

<li>See the "author's notes", marked in the text by <span class="authorsnote">italics</span>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>With the advent of R<sup>6</sup>RS, it has become possible to write and
distribute portable Scheme code as libraries.  However, there is no
agreed upon way to refer to SRFI libraries, leaving implementors to
create their own conventions thus thwarting portability of code which
relies on SRFIs.  So there is an immediate and obvious need for
standardized SRFI library names.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is a clear need to reexamine the existing body of
SRFI libraries and to come to a consensus on how to resolve issues, if
any, that arise under the latest Scheme standards.</p>

<p>Finally, because the library system of R<sup>6</sup>RS facilitates
the distribution of portable libraries, this SRFI will provide
portable reference implementations and test suites for SRFI libraries,
where possible.  Again, this facilitates distribution of portable code
that relies on SRFIs and can greatly benefit Scheme systems with
minimal or no support for SRFIs.</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>This specification includes a list of library names for existing
SRFIs that specify libraries.  These names are assigned according to a
naming convention given below. 


</p>

<p>Although R<sup>6</sup>RS's notion of a library is the one used here, this SRFI
attempts to minimize assumptions made about a Scheme systems
conformance to R<sup>6</sup>RS so that systems may support SRFI Libraries without
necessarily supporting all of R<sup>6</sup>RS.</p>

<h2>Referencing SRFI Libraries</h2>

<p>
A SRFI library reference has the following form,

<blockquote>
<code>(srfi <em>&lt;uinteger 10&gt;</em> <em>&lt;identifier&gt;</em> ...)</code>,
</blockquote>

where <code><em>&lt;identifier&gt;</em></code> is one of the included
SRFI library names defined below, and <code><em>&lt;uinteger
10&gt;</em></code> is one of the included SRFI numerals given below.
The non-terminals <code>&lt;uinteger 10&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;identifier&gt;</code> are defined as given in R<sup>6</sup>RS <a
href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs/r6rs-Z-H-7.html#node_chap_4">Chapter
4, Lexical syntax</a>.</p>

<p class="discussionnote">
<em>Discussion:</em> According to R<sup>6</sup>RS, library references consist
only of identifiers, so this naming scheme does not strictly conform
to R<sup>6</sup>RS, however this is a moderate and reasonable extension to
request that allows SRFI Libraries to remain <em>hierarchical</em>,
consistent with the precedent of the R<sup>6</sup>RS Standard Libraries.</p>

A SRFI Library can be referenced by number, as in
<blockquote>
<code>(srfi 1)</code>,
</blockquote>
or equivalently using the library's name, as in
<blockquote>
<code>(srfi 1 lists)</code>.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p class="discussionnote">
<em>Discussion:</em>
Even though the latter uses a library name, the SRFI number must still
be supplied.  This is done to ensure <em>fairness</em> and
<em>uniqueness</em>&mdash;a SRFI should not be able to prevent other
SRFIs from using the same name, but at the same time, SRFI library
references should remain unambiguous.
</p>

<p class="discussionnote">
<em>Discussion:</em> Since the number-only naming scheme ensures both
<em>uniqueness</em> and <em>fairness</em>, the named-library scheme is
redundant, but it is included to make library imports more readable.
Although the same could be achieved via a comment, comments are not
checked.  The named-library scheme can thus be used to increase the
likelihood that the correct library is imported.
</p>

<p>The remaining identifier subforms are used to name sublibraries
within a SRFI Library.  For example, SRFI 41, Streams, defines
<code>primitive</code> and <code>derived</code> libraries within the
<code>streams</code> library.  These can be referenced as
<blockquote>
<code>(srfi 41 streams primitive)</code>,<br/>
<code>(srfi 41 streams derived)</code>.
</blockquote>
</p>



<h2>Naming convention</h2>

<p>Libraries that define datatypes are typically pluralized (e.g.,
<code>arrays</code>, <code>basic-string-ports</code>).  Libraries that
provide new expression forms are named by the name of their new form
(e.g., <code>let-values</code>, <code>rec</code>,
<code>and-let*</code>).  Libraries that define a single procedure (or
that have a primary procedure) are given the name of the procedure
(e.g., <code>error</code>, <code>cat</code>).  Libraries that provide a
large API of syntaxes and values are named in a descriptive manner
derived from their title (e.g., <code>lightweight-testing</code>,
<code>real-time-multithreading</code>).  This naming
convention is consistent with the names chosen in the R<sup>6</sup>RS
Standard Libraries.</p>

<p class="discussionnote"> <em>Discussion:</em> There is opportunity
for grouping related SRFIs together.  For example, SRFI 28, Basic
Format Strings, and SRFI 48, Intermediate Format Strings, could be
grouped into a common <code>format</code> library with
<code>simple</code> and <code>intermediate</code> components.  This
has been avoided, preferring instead to follow a <em>one SRFI, one
(top-level) library</em> convention.  Although within a single SRFI,
several sub-libraries can be defined, thus achieving grouping.  This
simplifies the naming convention and prevents the need for a naming
authority which decides what shall and shall not be grouped together.
Instead, grouping must be achieved by the SRFI process, as it should.
</p>

<h2>Included SRFIs</h2>

<p>The criterion for inclusion in the set of SRFI Libraries is that
the finalized SRFI only specify a set of bindings which can be
provided as a library.  SRFI Libraries need not be implementable as an
R<sup>6</sup>RS library, but they must specify an interface which could be used
<em>as if it were</em>.  This means, for example, that lexical syntax
extensions cannot be a part of a SRFI Library.  SRFIs that specify
global semantic changes to Scheme also cannot be SRFI Libraries.  For
example, a Lazy Scheme SRFI or a SRFI that fixed order of evaluation
in procedure application could not be a SRFI Library because these
features cannot be provided as a set of bindings.</p>

<p>Some SRFIs specify alternative semantics to standard Scheme
bindings.  In some cases, such as SRFI 5's <code>let</code>, it's
clear that making the alternative binding for <code>let</code>
available as a library binding is desirable.  Authors that wish to
use SRFI 5's <code>let</code>, rather than R<sup>6</sup>RS's <code>let</code>,
simply import the SRFI 5 binding and exclude the R<sup>6</sup>RS binding for
<code>let</code> (or rename to avoid the clash).</p>

<p>Other SRFIs, however, define alternative bindings that are intended
to be used throughout a Scheme system.  For example, SRFI 63's
<code>equal?</code> and most of SRFI 70, Numbers, are defined like this.
But if the author intends for these bindings to <em>replace</em> the
standard bindings, then there is no way of making this feature
available as a library, so the SRFI cannot be a SRFI Library.
</p>

<p>The approach taken in this SRFI is that a SRFI is excluded as a
SRFI Library if it explicitly states the binding is to replace the
standard one.  For example, SRFI 70, Numbers, is excluded because it
explicitly revises the text of R<sup>5</sup>RS, thus intending to make
a global semantic change to the language which cannot be provided as a
library.  On the other hand, SRFI 63, Homogeneous and Heterogeneous
Arrays, is included and provides a binding for <code>equal?</code>
because the SRFI 63 document does not explicitly state this should
replace the standard <code>equal?</code> binding.</p>

<h2>Omitted SRFIs</h2>

<p>
SRFIs are not libraries, they are requests for <em>features</em>.
Thus, several SRFIs specify features which cannot be provided as a
library and those SRFIs are intentionally omitted here.  For example,
SRFIs which specify extensions to concrete syntax or extensions to the
semantics of top-level programs cannot be provided as libraries and
are therefore omitted from this SRFI.  The following table lists
omitted (finalized) SRFIs and the reason for their omission.<p>

<h2>Existing SRFIs and R<sup>6</sup>RS</h2>

<p>This section addresses any issues relevant to each existing SRFI's
use and implementation in an R<sup>6</sup>RS Scheme system.  These issues should
be addressed and resolved by general agreement so that SRFI Libraries
are consistent across implementations wherever possible.</p>

<p class="authorsnote">
I have identified only a small number of issues, outlined below.
Surely, there are further issues, so please send mail to the
discussion list if you know of others.
</p>


<ul>

<li>SRFI 9, Defining Record Types, and R<sup>6</sup>RS Records.  What relation
should SRFI 9 records have with R<sup>6</sup>RS records?  For example, does
<code>record?</code> hold of SRFI 9 record values?  Are SRFI 9 records
opaque?  Is the type name bound to a rtd?</li>

<li>SRFI 42, Eager Comprehensions, defines <em>qualifiers</em>, which
are used as macro keyword literals, and some of these conflict with
names provided by <code>(rnrs base)</code>.  Should anything be
specified about these keywords (eg, should this library provide
bindings?, the same bindings as in <code>(rnrs base)</code>?,
etc.)?</li>

<li>SRFI 74, Octet-Addressed Binary Blocks, blobs and R<sup>6</sup>RS
bytevectors are conceptually the same.  Should <code>(bytevector?
b)</code> imply <code>(blob?  b)</code> and vice versa?  This is the
case in reference implementation.</li> 

</ul>







<h2>Future SRFIs</h2>

<p>Authors of future SRFIs that specify libraries may choose names as
they please, but they are encouraged to use library names following
the naming convention of this SRFI.  If names are chosen that are not
compatible with the referencing scheme given here, authors should
specify alternative names that can be used to refer to the library
consistent with this specification.

<p>SRFI 41, Streams, for example, specifies that its libraries are
named by <code>(streams)</code>, <code>(streams primitive)</code>, and
<code>(streams derived)</code>, but according to this SRFI, they must
also be named with the prefix <code>(srfi 41 *)</code>.



<h2>Relation to SRFIs 0 and 7</h2>

<p>Both SRFI 0, Feature-based conditional expansion construct, and
SRFI 7, Feature-based program configuration language, use <em>feature
identifiers</em> of the form <code>srfi-N</code>, with the expectation
"that features will eventually be assigned meaningful names (aliases)
by the SRFI editors to make reading and writing code less tedious than
when using <code>srfi-N</code> feature identifiers."</p>

<p>It is recommended that implementations which support SRFIs 0 or 7
use the SRFI names defined here as aliases.  SRFI feature identifiers
are constructed by interpolating library references with
"<code>-</code>".  For example, the feature identifier for SRFI 1,
List Library, is <code>srfi-1</code>, or equivalently,
<code>srfi-1-lists</code>.  Feature identifiers for sub-libraries are
constructed in the same way, so for example the feature identifier for
the streams primitive library is
<code>srfi-41-streams-primitive</code>.

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>Code for the reference implementation is drawn from the SRFI
reference implementations, Gauche, Guile, Larceny, PLT Scheme, Scheme
48, and SLIB.  For discussions, I thank Will Clinger, Aziz Ghuloum,
Dave Herman, Olin Shivers, Andre van Tonder, and my fellow SRFI
editors.  During the development of this SRFI, all of the library
infrastructure was built using the van Tonder implementation of
R<sup>6</sup>RS Libraries and Macros, which has proved to be quite a
useful tool in writing portable Scheme code.  It was later tested on
Ikarus, Larceny, and PLT Scheme.</p>
