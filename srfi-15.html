<H1>Abstract</H1>

FLUID-LET, a binding syntax for dynamic scoping, is introduced.

<H1>Issues</H1>

None.

<H1>Rationale</H1>

FLUID-LET reduces the clutter of overriding the values of variables in a
dynamic scope while allowing nonlocal exits from and re-entries to that
scope.  Scheme systems have had FLUID-LET for years, though they do not
agree on its meaning.


<H1>Specification</H1>

<dl>
<dt>
(FLUID-LET &lt;bindings&gt; &lt;body&gt;)
<br> Syntax
<dd>
<p>&lt;Bindings&gt; should have the form ((&lt;variable1&gt; &lt;init1&gt;) ...) where
   each &lt;init&gt; is an expression.  It is an error for a &lt;variable&gt;
   to appear more than once in the list of variables.

<p>The &lt;init&gt;s are evaluated in the current environment, the values 
   of the &lt;variable&gt;s are saved, the results of the &lt;init&gt;s are 
   assigned to the &lt;variable&gt;s, and the &lt;body&gt; is evaluated in the
   current environment before the &lt;variable&gt;s are restored to their
   saved values and the values returned by the last expression of &lt;body&gt;
   are returned as the values of the entire expression.

<p>It is an error for the &lt;variable&gt;s to be unbound at the time their
   old values are saved.

<p>If control leaves the dynamic scope of the &lt;body&gt; before the last 
   expression of &lt;body&gt; has returned, then the current values of the 
   &lt;variables&gt;s inside the scope are saved and the saved values from 
   outside the scope are restored before control leaves the scope of 
   the FLUID-LET.  If control subsequently re-enters the scope of the
   &lt;body&gt;, then the current values of the &lt;variable&gt;s outside 
   the scope
   are saved and the saved values from inside the scope are restored 
   before execution continues inside &lt;body&gt;.  In this case, it is the
   last saved values from outside the scope that will be restored when 
   the &lt;body&gt; finally returns.

<pre>
             (define v 1)
             (define again #f)

             (define (test1)
               (display v)
               (fluid-let ((v 2))
                 (call-with-current-continuation
                   (lambda (k)
                     (set! again (lambda () 
                                   (set! again #f)
                                   (k #t)))))
                 (test2)
                 (set! v 3))
               (display v)
               (set! v 4)
               (if again (again)))

             (define (test2) (display v))       

             (test1)                    --&gt; 12134

<H1>Implementation</H1>

The following implementation is written in R5RS Scheme.  It is not
compatible with the IEEE Scheme standard because the IEEE standard does
not contain the high-level macro system.

<p>The implementation assumes that some top-level names defined by the
R5RS are bound to their original values.

<pre>
(define-syntax fluid-let
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((_ ((v1 e1) ...) b1 b2 ...)
     (fluid-let "temps" () ((v1 e1) ...) b1 b2 ...))
    ((_ "temps" (t ...) ((v1 e1) x ...) b1 b2 ...)
     (let ((temp e1))
       (fluid-let "temps" ((temp e1 v1) t ...) (x ...) b1 b2 ...)))
    ((_ "temps" ((t e v) ...) () b1 b2 ...)
     (let-syntax ((swap!
                   (syntax-rules ()
                     ((swap! a b)
                      (let ((tmp a))
                        (set! a b)
                        (set! b tmp))))))
       (dynamic-wind
        (lambda ()
          (swap! t v) ...)
        (lambda ()
          b1 b2 ...)
        (lambda ()
          (swap! t v) ...))))))
