<h1>Abstract</h1>

Checks for division by zero (and their absence) remain one of the most
common programming errors.  In numerical code the conscientious
programmer must deeply nest conditionals to assure that checks for
zero preceed each division.
<P>
With infinities added to the number system we find that division by
zero "works".  It lets initialization of variables precede bounds
checks and gives flexibility in placement of those checks.  Limit and
corner cases need not crash programs.
<P>
This SRFI reworks section 6.2 "Numbers" of R5RS to:

<UL>
 <LI> include inexact real positive and negative infinities,

 <LI> define complete semantics for <SAMP>`expt'</SAMP>,

 <LI> extend <SAMP>`gcd'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`lcm'</SAMP> to exact
      rational numbers,

 <LI> extend <SAMP>`quotient'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`modulo'</SAMP>, and
      <SAMP>`remainder'</SAMP> to finite real numbers,

 <LI> remove a contradiction related to exactness,

 <LI> add examples, and

 <LI> make small improvements to the text.

</UL>


<h1>Issues</h1>

<UL>
<LI> (expt 0 0) has many similarities to (/ 0 0).  Having it return
     0/0 is the right thing to do, but conflicts with R5RS, which
     returns 1.
<P>
<LI> Supporting 0/0 (versus signaling an error) makes
     <CODE>limit</CODE> more robust; should 0/0 be mandated as the
     result of <CODE>(expt 0 0)</CODE> and <CODE>(/ 0 0)</CODE>?
<P>
<LI> Should <CODE>odd?</CODE> and <CODE>even?</CODE> be restricted to
     exact integer arguments?
<P>
<LI> Should <CODE>round</CODE>, <CODE>truncate</CODE>,
     <CODE>ceiling</CODE>, and <CODE>floor</CODE> be changed to return
     exact integers?
<P>
<LI> Should there be exact-only versions of <CODE>expt</CODE> and
     <CODE>sqrt</CODE>?
<P>
</UL>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<h3>Inexactness</h3>

<!-- "6.2.1 Numerical types" states: -->
<!-- <BLOCKQUOTE> -->
<!--   In order to catch uses of inexact numbers where exact numbers are -->
<!--   required, Scheme explicitly distinguishes exact from inexact numbers. -->
<!--   This distinction is orthogonal to the dimension of type. -->
<!-- </BLOCKQUOTE> -->

Inexactness is as much a property of calculation as it is of data
sources.  A language having latent types does not obviate the
programmer's expectation that a calculation involving transcendental
functions should return an inexact result.  To this end, two sentences
are struck from the 6.2.2 "Exactness" section:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  An operation may, however, return an exact result if it can prove
  that the value of the result is unaffected by the inexactness of its
  arguments.  For example, multiplication of any number by an exact
  zero may produce an exact zero result, even if the other argument is
  inexact.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<!-- Those sentences allowed the change of exactness of results of -->
<!-- multiplication and transcendental functions <EM>only</EM> for the case -->
<!-- of an exact 0 argument (unless some implementation has exact -->
<!-- transcendentals). -->
<!-- <P> -->

By those sentences, <EM>inexactness</EM> is a contagious property of
all numbers; except 0, the only number whose <EM>exactness</EM> is
contagious!  This conflicts with the statement earlier in 6.2.2:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  ... Thus inexactness is a contagious property of a number.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<!-- Exactness depending on value is worse than the -->
<!-- exactness-dependent-on-type disallowed by the orthogonality quote -->
<!-- above. -->

For code expecting inexact arguments, such an exception creates a
latent bug which may be exercised only rarely.  SRFI-63 is a case in
point:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  When assigning an exact number to an inexact array-type, the
  procedure may report a violation of an implementation restriction.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<!-- The programmer's expectation that transcendental functions return -->
<!-- inexacts becomes ambiguous for <SAMP>`expt'</SAMP> (and -->
<!-- <SAMP>`sqrt'</SAMP>, which isn't transcendental, just irrational). -->

Also struck is the last sentence of section
<A HREF="#6.2.1">6.2.1 Numerical types</A>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  ... In order to catch uses of inexact numbers where exact numbers are
  required, Scheme explicitly distinguishes exact from inexact numbers.
  <STRIKE>This distinction is orthogonal to the dimension of type.</STRIKE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

which seems to imply that each internal number representation is
instantiated both in exact and inexact forms.

<H3>Integer versus Exact</H3>

R5RS describes <CODE>quotient</CODE>, <CODE>remainder</CODE>, and
<CODE>modulo</CODE> as <EM>integer</EM> operations.  They are
required to work for integers, whether exact or inexact.  The use of
<VAR>N</VAR> for names of their arguments similarly declares
<CODE>gcd</CODE>, <CODE>lcm</CODE>, <CODE>odd?</CODE>, and
<CODE>even?</CODE> to be integer operations.
<P>
But these operations become poorly behaved for inexacts outside the
range where each integer has a unique representation.  For instance,
all large magnitude IEEE-754 numbers are integers and even (a multiple
of 2) because the radix, and hence the scaling factors, are even.
<!-- <P> -->
<!-- Continuous functions can operate reasonably on approximate numbers. -->
<!-- But the oscillations of <CODE>modulo</CODE> and <CODE>remainder</CODE> -->
<!-- do not reduce as their inputs tend to infinity.  <CODE>gcd</CODE> and -->
<!-- <CODE>lcm</CODE> are wildly discontinuous. -->
<P>
Distinguishing these functions on the basis of integer arguments
overlooks their generalizations to exact rational numbers:

<PRE>
    modulo(x/y, w/z) = modulo(lcm(y, z)*x/y, lcm(y, z)*w/z)/lcm(y, z)
    remainder(x/y, w/z) = remainder(lcm(y, z)*x/y, lcm(y, z)*w/z)/lcm(y, z)
    gcd(x/y, w/z) = gcd(x, w)/lcm(y, z)
    lcm(x/y, w/z) = lcm(x, w)/gcd(y, z)
</PRE>

Common-Lisp
<A HREF="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/hyperspec/HyperSpec/Body/fun_modcm_rem.html">mod and rem</A>
are general to rational and real arguments:

<PRE>
(mod 2/3 1/5)               ==>  1/15
(mod .666 1/5)              ==>  0.065999985
</PRE>

This SRFI extends <CODE>quotient</CODE>, <CODE>remainder</CODE>, and
<CODE>modulo</CODE> to work for exact rationals and inexact reals.
<P>
<!-- <CODE>Modulo</CODE> and <CODE>remainder</CODE> find use in -->
<!-- calculations for string, vector, and array indexes, which must be -->
<!-- exact integers. -->
<!-- <P> -->

In inexact calculations, one is not guaranteed that results will yield
integers.  Thus <CODE>odd?</CODE> and <CODE>even?</CODE> will
sometimes signal errors or give false negatives when inexact integer
calculations are slightly wide of their integer marks.  If these
predicates instead accept only exact integers, then their behavior is
predictable; and conversion from inexacts to exacts must be explicit.


<h3>Infinities</h3>

This SRFI introduces inexact real infinities for implementations with
inexact numbers.  These infinities arise as the result of:

<UL>
<LI>division by 0

<LI>taking logarithm of 0.

<LI>product, division, sum, difference, tangent, or exponentiation
whose mathematical result is outside the range of the implementation's
number formats.

</UL>

This SRFI attempts to strike a balance between tolerance and signaling
of range errors.  Having 1/0 and -1/0 allows one level of calculation
to be executed before bounds checking.  Subsequent numerical
calculations on infinities can signal an error or return a non-real
infinity: 0/0.  0/0 can be considered an error waiting to happen.
<P>
This SRFI mandates the real infinities for implementations with
inexacts, but leaves to the implementations the decision of whether to
implement 0/0 or not.
<P>
<DL>
<DT>Are there predicates for infinities?

<DD>The new <CODE>`finite?'</CODE> predicate will return <SAMP>`#f'</SAMP>
for infinities, <SAMP>`#t'</SAMP> for other numbers;<BR>
<CODE>`real?'</CODE> will return <SAMP>`#f'</SAMP> for <SAMP>`0/0'</SAMP>; and<BR>
the two real infinities have opposite signs.

<DT><A NAME="exact infinities">What about exact infinities?</A>

<DD>1/0 + 1 = 1/0; the only numbers which can be their own increments
are inexact numbers.

<DT>Can infinities be the only inexacts an implementation supports?

<DD>That would mean that any divisions not returning exact numbers
would either signal an error or return an infinity.  Most of the
transcendental functions would return only infinities.


<DT>Are real infinities rational?

<DD>No; (mathematical) rational numbers have non-zero denominators.


<DT>Are real infinities integers?

<DD>Because they are not rational they cannot be integers.


<DT>What about complex (non-real) infinities?

<DD>Infinities in rectangular notation leads to strange beasts like
1/0+5i.  I know of no mathematical system having such numbers.  Polar
notation allows an infinitude of numbers having infinite magnitude and
finite angle.  Multiplication and division of complex infinities would
work, but at the price of forcing their representations to be polar.

<DT>What about +0.0 and -0.0?

<DD>Dealing with zero is certainly thorny; but having more varieties
of zero does not make dealing with unsigned zero any easier.

The <A HREF="#6.2.2x">limit</A> procedure provides a mathematical
alternative to non-standard analysis half-measures.

<!-- If real infinities are inexact, than their reciprocals are also -->
<!-- inexact.  If +0.0 and -0.0 are close enough to 0.0 to behave like 0.0, -->
<!-- then they are 0.0. -->

</DL>

<H3>0/0 = 0/0</H3>

The bad boy of IEEE Standard 754 is <EM>not-a-number</EM>, which
does not equal itself.  This was a cute trick to provide a means for
software to detect it without requiring literal constants or new
comparison primitives.
<P>
But reflexive identity is one of the most basic mathematical
principals.  In implementations where inexact numbers are boxed

<PRE>
    (let ((narn (/ 0.0 0.0))) (eq? narn narn))
</PRE>

is required to be true, which forces <CODE>eqv?</CODE> to return true
in the same situation:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
     <CODE>Eq?</CODE>'s behavior on numbers and characters is
     implementation-dependent, but it will always return either true
     or false, and <U>will return true only when <CODE>eqv?</CODE> would
     also return true.</U>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The <SAMP>`='</SAMP> procedure is similarly forced to find
<VAR>narn</VAR> equal to itself.

<H3>sqrt</H3>

The description of <CODE>sqrt</CODE> has been wrong since R3RS.
Prepending "For real <VAR>z</VAR>" to the second sentence corrects it.



<H3>expt</H3>

In R3RS and R4RS the description of <CODE>expt</CODE> is very simple:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <DL>
    <DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>expt</B> <I>z1 z2</I>
    <DD><A NAME="IDX388"></A>


    <P>
    Returns <VAR>z1</VAR> raised to the power <VAR>z2</VAR>:


    <P>
    z_1<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>z_2</SUP></FONT> = e<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>z_2 log z_1</SUP></FONT>


    <P>
    0<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>0</SUP></FONT> is defined to be equal to 1.
    </DL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The simplicity is nice, but in the absence of infinities, the
straightforward scheme implementation

<PRE>
    (define (expt b x) (exp (* x (log b))))
</PRE>

is incapable of operating when <VAR>b</VAR> is zero.
<P>
According to G. Sussman, the change in R5RS to
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
0<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>z</SUP></FONT> is 1 if z = 0 and 0 otherwise.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

was "... attempting to follow Common Lisp and APL when it came to
boundary conditions and branch cuts."

<P>
About <CODE>expt</CODE>,
<A HREF="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/hyperspec/HyperSpec/Body/fun_expcm_expt.html">
Common-Lisp</A> says:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <CODE>expt</CODE> is defined as b<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>x</SUP></FONT> = e<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>x</SUP></FONT> log b.  This defines the
  principal values precisely.  The range of expt is the entire complex
  plane.  Regarded as a function of x, with b fixed, there is no branch
  cut.  Regarded as a function of b, with x fixed, there is in general a
  branch cut along the negative real axis, continuous with quadrant II.
  The domain excludes the origin.  By definition, 0<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>0</SUP></FONT>=1.  If b=0 and the
  real part of x is strictly positive, then b<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>x</SUP></FONT>=0.  For all other values
  of x, 0<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>x</SUP></FONT> is an error.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

With log(0) being -1/0, and because exp(-1/0) is 0.0, Common-Lisp
behavior would follow from:

<PRE>
    (define (expt b x) (exp (* x (log b))))
</PRE>

except when <VAR>b</VAR> is zero.
<P>
With <CODE>(log 0)</CODE> being -1/0, the product of <VAR>x</VAR> and
-1/0 determines the trajectory of <CODE>exp</CODE>.
<CODE>Exp</CODE>'s domain repeats every 2*pi radians in the imaginary
direction.  This multiplication rotates the negative real infinity.
If it rotates into a direction other than pure real, then the limit of
<CODE>(exp (* b (log x)))</CODE> does not exist (because of the 2*pi
periodicity).
<P>
Common-Lisp's criterion of testing the sign of the real part of
<VAR>x</VAR> can be seen as snapping the direction of the product to
either a positive or negative real infinity.

<PRE>
(exp (* 1 -1/0))            ==>  0.0
(exp (* -1 -1/0))           ==>  1/0
</PRE>

Because Common-Lisp doesn't have explicit infinities, it signals an
error for negative real parts of <VAR>x</VAR>.  The Common-Lisp
behavior except, for <CODE>(expt 0.0 0.0)</CODE>, can be produced by

<PRE>
(define (expt <VAR>z1</VAR> <VAR>z2</VAR>) (exp (* (if (zero? <VAR>z1</VAR>) (real-part <VAR>z2</VAR>) <VAR>z2</VAR>) (log <VAR>z1</VAR>))))
</PRE>

<P>
Having real infinities enables these definitions to work when
<VAR>z1</VAR> is zero.  Although the simpler definition is
mathematically satisfying, the "real-part" variant allows

<CODE>(expt 0.0 <VAR>z</VAR>)</CODE> to return something other than
0/0 when the exponent has small imaginary parts due to inexact
inaccuracies.
<P>
The approach of this SRFI is to use this latter definition without
excepting <CODE>(expt 0.0 0.0)</CODE>, which either returns 0/0 or
signals an error.  <CODE>(expt 0.0 <VAR>z</VAR>)</CODE>, where
<VAR>z</VAR> has a negative real-part, returns 1/0, where Common-Lisp
signals an error.  Otherwise the behavior is the same as Common-Lisp's
<CODE>expt</CODE>.



<H3>Inexactness Considered Harmful?</H3>

Sebastian Egner, Richard Kelsey, Michael Sperber:<BR>

The 2004 Scheme Workshop, Snowbird, Utah, October 2004.

<H4>Abstract</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The R5RS specification of numerical operations leads to unportable
  and intransparent behavior of programs.  Specifically, the notion of
  "exact/inexact numbers" and the misleading distinction between
  "real" and "rational" numbers are two primary sources of confusion.
  Consequently, the way R5RS organizes numbers is significantly less
  useful than it could be.  Based on this diagnosis, we propose to
  abandon the concept of exact/inexact numbers from Scheme altogether.
  In this paper, we examine designs in which exact and inexact
  rounding operations are explicitly separated, while there is no
  distinction between exact and inexact numbers.  Through examining
  alternatives and practical ramifications, we arrive at an
  alternative proposal for the design of the numerical operations in
  Scheme.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

In my view the essential distinction of number-theoretic operations is
that they are <EM>exact</EM>, not that they are <EM>integer</EM> as
R5RS holds.  This SRFI rectifies the problem by extending most of the
affected procedures.  Restricting the integer operations to exact
integer arguments would also work.
<P>
<CITE>Cleaning up the Tower</CITE> demotes the exactness property
relative to types while this SRFI promotes it.  Yet both find that the
exactness of procedures should play a more important role in
determining the exactness of numerical results.
<P>
In their proposed system:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Any program that does not contain calls to floating-point operations
  always computes exactly and reproducibly, independent of the Scheme
  implementation it runs on.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This will require either
<UL>

<LI> mandating Scheme implementations to support exact rational
bignums; or

<LI> disallowing numeric routines from returning exact rational
numbers.

</UL>

As an author of a Scheme implementation, I find the first option
unappealing; coding a complicated feature to solve a problem that the
implementation doesn't have.  If some feature must be jettisoned, then
removing exact rational non-integers might be a simpler and less
wrenching alternative than removing exactness as an organizing
principle.  Experience with SCM shows that the R5RS number system can
work well without exact rational non-integers.
<P>
Full reproducibility will require extensive changes to R5RS:

<UL>

<LI>The removal of optional status for the R5RS procedures
<SAMP>`transcript-on'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`transcript-off'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`load'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`with-output-to-file'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`with-input-to-file'</SAMP>, and
<SAMP>`interaction-environment'</SAMP>; as well as multi-argument
varieties of <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>.

<LI>The phrase "is an error" occurs 22 times in R5RS.  The response to
all of those conditions must be explicitly specified.

</UL>

The reproducibility condition is too strong; it needs restrictions so
that it doesn't expose properties of the host file system.

<!-- <P> -->
<!-- Is easy reproducibility of programs being oversold?  Well-conditioned -->
<!-- inexact computations are reproducible in the sense that the variation -->
<!-- in results will be small.  To my knowledge there is no shortcut around -->
<!-- the necessary numerical analysis. -->
<!-- <P> -->
<!-- All high quality pseudo-random-number generators are exact and often -->
<!-- reversible.  There are important exact random algorithms, such as -->
<!-- primality tests (Solovay-Strassen), polynomial factorization, theorem -->
<!-- proving, and in graph-theory. -->
<P>

<H3>Clean Infinities</H3>

The treatment of infinities by <CITE>"Cleaning up the Tower"</CITE>
also differs from this SRFI.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  ... an exact division by zero is virtually always a symptom of a
  genuine programming error or of illegal input data, and the
  introduction of infinity will only mask this error.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This is not the case in the R5RS model, where substitution of exact
for inexact does not change the computation.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The advantage of returning NaN instead of raising an error is that
  the computation still continues, postponing the interpretation of
  the results to a more convenient point in the program.  In this way,
  NaN is quite useful in numerical computations.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

While finding 1/0 and -1/0 to be very useful in computation, I cannot
say the same for 0/0.  It usually arises as the result of operating on
a real infinity.  Tolerating one error is useful; tolerating more than
one error in a computation masks programming errors.  That is why this
SRFI leaves to the implementation whether to signal an error or return
0/0.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The problem with NaN is that the program control structure will
  mostly not recognize the NaN case explicitly.  Assume we define
  comparisons with NaN always to result in #f, as IEEE 754 does, then
  <PRE>(do ((x NaN (+ x 1))) ((&gt; x 10)))</PRE>
  will hang but
  <PRE>(do ((x NaN (+ x 1))) ((not (&lt;= x 10))))</PRE>
  will stop, which is counter-intuitive and may be surprising.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Because it has no sensible place in the well ordering of real numbers,
0/0 (NaN) is not a real number.  Thus it is an illegal argument to the
comparison procedures <SAMP>`&lt;'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`&lt;='</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`&gt;'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`&gt;='</SAMP>; which should signal an
error upon encountering it.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  While +inf, -inf, and NaN are quite useful for inexact computations,
  there is a high price to pay when they are carried over into the
  exact world: The rational numbers must be extended by the special
  objects, and the usual algebraic laws will not hold for the
  extension anymore.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This need not be the case.  This "high price" is a consequence of the
proposed (section 5) "type permeability" kinds #2 and #3, which
prohibit exact arguments to inexact procedures.
<P>
As <A HREF="#exact infinities">shown earlier</A>, infinities are
always inexact.  Infinities being inexact makes detecting them in
exact calculations easier.  Not only will the <SAMP>`finite?'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`rational?'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`exact?'</SAMP> procedures return
<SAMP>`#f'</SAMP> for infinities; but passing infinities to exact-only
or integer-only procedures is an error.

<H3>The Limit</H3>

Many Scheme implementations treat an exact 0 as <EM>stronger</EM> than
an inexact 0.0; returning 0 for <CODE>(/ 0 0.0)</CODE> while signaling
an error for <CODE>(/ 0.0 0)</CODE>.  This leads to the use of
exactness coercions to select behavior of <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`expt'</SAMP>; a practice which is very opaque.
<P>
Each implementation supporting flonums must decide how to evaluate
<CODE>(/ 0.0 0.0)</CODE> and <CODE>(expt 0.0 0.0)</CODE> because those
functions are mathematically ill-defined for all-zero arguments.
Cases can be made for 1.0 and 0.0 because the limits of

<CODE>(/ x x)</CODE> and <CODE>(/ 0.0 x)</CODE> are 1.0 and 0.0
respectively.  But why are we statically determining behavior in a
dynamic language?  This SRFI introduces the

<A HREF="#6.2.2x"><SAMP>`limit'</SAMP></A> procedure to produce the
mathematically expected behavior of finite and infinite limits of
functions.

<H2><U>6.2 Numbers</U></H2>

<P>



<P>



<P>
Numerical computation has traditionally been neglected by the Lisp
community.  Until Common Lisp there was no carefully thought out
strategy for organizing numerical computation, and with the exception
of the MacLisp system <A HREF="r5rs_13.html#BIB20">[Pitman83]</A>
little effort was made to execute numerical code efficiently.  This
report recognizes the excellent work of the Common Lisp committee and
accepts many of their recommendations.  In some ways this report
simplifies and generalizes their proposals in a manner consistent with
the purposes of Scheme.


<P>
It is important to distinguish between the mathematical numbers, the
Scheme numbers that attempt to model them, the machine representations
used to implement the Scheme numbers, and notations used to write numbers.
This report uses the types <I>number</I>, <I>complex</I>, <I>real</I>,
<I>rational</I>, and <I>integer</I> to refer to both mathematical numbers
and Scheme numbers.  Machine representations such as fixed point and
floating point are referred to by names such as <I>fixnum</I> and
<I>flonum</I>.



<A NAME="6.2.1"></A>
<H3>6.2.1 Numerical types</H3>

<P>



<P>
Mathematically, numbers may be arranged into a tower of subtypes
in which each level is a subset of the level above it:



<PRE>
          number
          complex
          real
          rational
          integer
</PRE>

<P>
For example, 3 is an integer.  Therefore 3 is also a rational,
a real, and a complex.  The same is true of the Scheme numbers
that model 3.  For Scheme numbers, these types are defined by the
predicates <CODE>number?</CODE>, <CODE>complex?</CODE>, <CODE>real?</CODE>, <CODE>rational?</CODE>,




and <CODE>integer?</CODE>.



<P>
There is no simple relationship between a number's type and its
representation inside a computer.  Although most implementations of
Scheme will offer at least two different representations of 3, these
different representations denote the same integer.


<P>
Scheme's numerical operations treat numbers as abstract data, as
independent of their representation as possible.  Although an implementation
of Scheme may use fixnum, flonum, and perhaps other representations for
numbers, this should not be apparent to a casual programmer writing
simple programs.


<P>
It is necessary, however, to distinguish between numbers that are
represented exactly and those that may not be.  For example, indexes
into data structures must be known exactly, as must some polynomial
coefficients in a symbolic algebra system.  On the other hand, the
results of measurements are inherently inexact, and irrational numbers
may be approximated by rational and therefore inexact approximations.
In order to catch uses of inexact numbers where exact numbers are
required, Scheme explicitly distinguishes exact from inexact numbers.
<STRIKE>This distinction is orthogonal to the dimension of type.</STRIKE>



<A NAME="6.2.2"></A>
<H3>6.2.2 Exactness</H3>

<P>



<P>

Scheme numbers are either <I>exact</I> or <I>inexact</I>.  A number is
exact if it was written as an exact constant or was derived from
exact numbers using only exact operations.  A number is
inexact if it <FONT COLOR=red>is infinite, if it </FONT>was written as an inexact constant,
if it was
derived using inexact ingredients, or if it was derived using
inexact operations. Thus inexactness is a contagious
property of a number.


<P>
If two implementations produce exact results for a
computation that did not involve inexact intermediate results,
the two ultimate results will be mathematically equivalent.  This is
generally not true of computations involving inexact numbers
<STRIKE>since</STRIKE> <FONT COLOR=red>because</FONT>
approximate methods such as floating point arithmetic may be used,
but it is the duty of each implementation to make the result as close as
practical to the mathematically ideal result.


<P>
Rational operations such as <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> should always produce
exact results when given exact arguments.
If the operation is unable to produce an exact result,
then it may either report the violation of an implementation restriction
or it may silently coerce its
result to an inexact value.
See section <A HREF="#6.2.3">6.2.3 Implementation restrictions</A>.


<P>
With the exception of <CODE>inexact-&#62;exact</CODE>, the operations
described in this section must
<STRIKE>generally</STRIKE>
return inexact results when given any inexact arguments.
<STRIKE>
An operation may, however, return an exact result if it can prove that
the value of the result is unaffected by the inexactness of its
arguments.  For example, multiplication of any number by an exact zero
may produce an exact zero result, even if the other argument is
inexact.

<A NAME="6.2.3"></A>
<H3>6.2.3 Implementation restrictions</H3>

<P>



<P>



<P>
Implementations of Scheme are not required to implement the whole
tower of subtypes given in section <A HREF="#6.2.1">6.2.1 Numerical types</A>,
but they must implement a coherent subset consistent with both the
purposes of the implementation and the spirit of the Scheme language.
For example, an implementation in which all numbers are real
may still be quite useful.


<P>
Implementations may also support only a limited range of numbers of
any type, subject to the requirements of this section.  The supported
range for exact numbers of any type may be different from the
supported range for inexact numbers of that type.  For example,
an implementation that uses flonums to represent all its
inexact real numbers may
support a practically unbounded range of exact integers
and rationals
while limiting the range of inexact reals (and therefore
the range of inexact integers and rationals)
to the dynamic range of the flonum format.
Furthermore
the gaps between the representable inexact integers and
rationals are
likely to be very large in such an implementation as the limits of this
range are approached.


<P>
An implementation of Scheme must support exact integers
throughout the range of numbers that may be used for indexes of
lists, vectors, and strings or that may result from computing the length of a
list, vector, or string.  The <CODE>length</CODE>, <CODE>vector-length</CODE>,


and <CODE>string-length</CODE> procedures must return an exact

integer, and it is an error to use anything but an exact integer as an
index.  Furthermore any integer constant within the index range, if
expressed by an exact integer syntax, will indeed be read as an exact
integer, regardless of any implementation restrictions that may apply
outside this range.  Finally, the procedures listed below will always
return an exact integer result provided all their arguments are exact integers
and the mathematically expected result is representable as an exact integer
within the implementation:



<PRE>

+            -             *
quotient     remainder     modulo
max          min           abs
numerator    denominator   gcd
lcm          floor         ceiling
truncate     round         rationalize
expt

</PRE>

<P>
Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to support exact
integers and exact rationals of practically unlimited size and
precision, and to implement the above procedures and the
<SAMP>`/'</SAMP> procedure in such a way that they always return exact
results when given exact arguments.  If one of these procedures is
unable to deliver an exact result when given exact arguments, then it
may either report a violation of an implementation restriction or it
may silently coerce its result to an inexact number.  Such a coercion
may cause an error later.
<P>

An implementation may use floating point and other approximate
representation strategies for inexact numbers.


<P>
This report recommends, but does not require, that the IEEE 32-bit
and 64-bit floating point standards be followed by implementations that use
flonum representations, and that implementations using
other representations should match or exceed the precision achievable
using these floating point standards <A HREF="r5rs_13.html#BIB12">[IEEE]</A>.


<P>
In particular, implementations that use flonum representations
must follow these rules: A flonum result
must be represented with at least as much precision as is used to express any of
the inexact arguments to that operation.  It is desirable (but not required) for
potentially inexact operations such as <SAMP>`sqrt'</SAMP>, when applied to exact
arguments, to produce exact answers whenever possible (for example the
square root of an exact 4 ought to be an exact 2).
If, however, an
exact number is operated upon so as to produce an inexact result
(as by <SAMP>`sqrt'</SAMP>), and if the result is represented as a flonum, then
the most precise flonum format available must be used; but if the result
is represented in some other way then the representation must have at least as
much precision as the most precise flonum format available.

<P>
Although Scheme allows a variety of written
notations for
numbers, any particular implementation may support only some of them.
For example, an implementation in which all numbers are real
need not support the rectangular and polar notations for complex
numbers.  If an implementation encounters an exact numerical constant that
it cannot represent as an exact number, then it may either report a
violation of an implementation restriction or it may silently represent the
constant by an inexact number.


<A NAME="6.2.4"></A>
<H3>6.2.4 Syntax of numerical constants</H3>

<P>



<P>
The syntax of the written representations for numbers is described formally in
section <A HREF="#7.1.1">7.1.1 Lexical structure</A>.  Note that case is not significant in numerical
constants.


<P>
A number may be written in binary, octal, decimal, or
hexadecimal by the use of a radix prefix.  The radix prefixes are <SAMP>`#b'</SAMP> (binary), <SAMP>`#o'</SAMP> (octal), <SAMP>`#d'</SAMP> (decimal), and <SAMP>`#x'</SAMP> (hexadecimal).  With




no radix prefix, a number is assumed to be expressed in decimal.


<P>
A
numerical constant may be specified to be either exact or
inexact by a prefix.  The prefixes are <SAMP>`#e'</SAMP>

for exact, and <SAMP>`#i'</SAMP> for inexact.  An exactness

prefix may appear before or after any radix prefix that is used.  If
the written representation of a number has no exactness prefix, the
constant may be either inexact or exact.  It is inexact if it contains
a decimal point, an exponent, a "#" character in the place of a digit,
<FONT COLOR=red>or ends with "/0"; </FONT>otherwise it is exact.

<P>
<FONT COLOR=red>Negative infinity is written </FONT><SAMP><FONT COLOR=red>`-1/0'</FONT></SAMP> <FONT COLOR=red>(or</FONT>
<SAMP><FONT COLOR=red>`#i-1/0'</FONT></SAMP><FONT COLOR=red>).  Positive infinity is written</FONT>
<SAMP><FONT COLOR=red>`1/0'</FONT></SAMP> <FONT COLOR=red>or </FONT><SAMP><FONT COLOR=red>`+1/0'</FONT></SAMP><FONT COLOR=red>.  The (optional) non-real</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=red>infinity is written </FONT><SAMP><FONT COLOR=red>`0/0'</FONT></SAMP><FONT COLOR=red>.  Although the written forms of</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=red>infinity look like exact rational numbers, infinities are neither</FONT>
<FONT COLOR=red>exact nor rational.</FONT>

<P>
In systems with inexact numbers
of varying precisions it may be useful to specify
the precision of a constant.  For this purpose, numerical constants
may be written with an exponent marker that indicates the
desired precision of the inexact
representation.  The letters <SAMP>`s'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`f'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`d'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`l'</SAMP> specify the use of <VAR>short</VAR>, <VAR>single</VAR>,
<VAR>double</VAR>, and <VAR>long</VAR> precision, respectively.  (When fewer
than four internal
inexact
representations exist, the four size
specifications are mapped onto those available.  For example, an
implementation with two internal representations may map short and
single together and long and double together.)  In addition, the
exponent marker <SAMP>`e'</SAMP> specifies the default precision for the
implementation.  The default precision has at least as much precision
as <VAR>double</VAR>, but
implementations may wish to allow this default to be set by the user.

The reader is referred to section <A HREF="#1.3.3">1.3.3 Entry

<P>
The examples used in this section assume that any numerical constant written
using an exact notation is indeed represented as an exact
number.  Some examples also assume that certain numerical constants written
using an inexact notation can be represented without loss of
accuracy; the inexact constants were chosen so that this is
likely to be true in implementations that use flonums to represent
inexact numbers.

<SAMP>`Rationalize'</SAMP> returns the <EM>simplest</EM> rational number
differing from <VAR>x</VAR> by no more than <VAR>y</VAR>.  A rational number r_1 is

r_2 if r_1 = p_1/q_1 and r_2 = p_2/q_2 (in lowest terms) and |p_1|&#60;= |p_2| and |q_1| &#60;= |q_2|.  Thus 3/5 is simpler than 4/7.
Although not all rationals are comparable in this ordering (consider 2/7
and 3/5) any interval contains a rational number that is simpler than
every other rational number in that interval (the simpler 2/5 lies
between 2/7 and 3/5).  Note that 0 = 0/1 is the simplest rational of
